In this report, we consider a common problem in musical machine learning: classification by genre. Specifically, we attempt to classify the well-known GTZAN dataset of a thousand 30-second snippets of songs divided evenly across the genres of blues, classical, country, disco, hip-hop, jazz, metal, pop, reggae, and rock \cite{GTZAN}.

The remainder of this paper describes some of the existing research genre classification, our methods of extracting and transforming features from the data, and the trials we ran to explore the relative effectiveness of various combinations of features and classifiers. We conclude by presenting and discussing the results of these trials.
