used in cell signaling. This motif itself can generate a variety of dynamic
behaviors like bistability and ultrasensitivity without direct positive
feedbacks. In this paper, we study the number of positive steady states of a
general multisite phosphorylation-dephosphorylation cycle, and how the number
of positive steady states varies by changing the biological parameters. We show
analytically that (1) for some parameter ranges, there are at least n+1 (if n
is even) or n (if n is odd) steady states; (2) there never are more than 2n-1
steady states (in particular, this implies that for n=2, including single
levels of MAPK cascades, there are at most three steady states); (3) for
parameters near the standard Michaelis-Menten quasi-steady state conditions,
there are at most n+1 steady states; and (4) for parameters far from the
standard Michaelis-Menten quasi-steady state conditions, there is at most one
steady state.

especially in the study of the evolution of life and cognition. Traditional
studies encounter problems because it is difficult to describe life and
cognition in terms of matter and energy, since their laws are valid only at the
physical scale. However, if matter and energy, as well as life and cognition,
are described in terms of information, evolution can be described consistently
as information becoming more complex.
  The paper presents eight tentative laws of information, valid at multiple
scales, which are generalizations of Darwinian, cybernetic, thermodynamic,
psychological, philosophical, and complexity principles. These are further used
to discuss the notions of life, cognition and their evolution.

have strict topological constraints and consequently they cannot take into
account a wide range of external stimuli. Furthermore their evolution is
conditioned by deterministic laws which often are not correlated with the
structural parameters and the global status of the network, as it should happen
in a real biological system. In nature the environmental inputs are noise
affected and fuzzy. Which thing sets the problem to investigate the possibility
of emergent behaviour in a not strictly constrained net and subjected to
different inputs. It is here presented a new model of Evolutionary Neural Gas
(ENG) with any topological constraints, trained by probabilistic laws depending
on the local distortion errors and the network dimension. The network is
considered as a population of nodes that coexist in an ecosystem sharing local
and global resources. Those particular features allow the network to quickly
adapt to the environment, according to its dimensions. The ENG model analysis
shows that the net evolves as a scale-free graph, and justifies in a deeply
physical sense- the term gas here used.

Chem</comments><journal-ref>J. Comp. Chem. (2008) 1408-1422</journal-ref><doi>10.1002/jcc.20900</doi><abstract>  We present an exhaustive study of more than 250 ab initio potential energy
surfaces (PESs) of the model dipeptide HCO-L-Ala-NH2. The model chemistries
(MCs) used are constructed as homo- and heterolevels involving possibly
different RHF and MP2 calculations for the geometry and the energy. The basis
sets used belong to a sample of 39 selected representants from Pople's
split-valence families, ranging from the small 3-21G to the large
6-311++G(2df,2pd). The reference PES to which the rest are compared is the
MP2/6-311++G(2df,2pd) homolevel, which, as far as we are aware, is the more
accurate PES of a dipeptide in the literature. The aim of the study presented
is twofold: On the one hand, the evaluation of the influence of polarization
and diffuse functions in the basis set, distinguishing between those placed at
1st-row atoms and those placed at hydrogens, as well as the effect of different
contraction and valence splitting schemes. On the other hand, the investigation
of the heterolevel assumption, which is defined here to be that which states
that heterolevel MCs are more efficient than homolevel MCs. The heterolevel
approximation is very commonly used in the literature, but it is seldom
checked. As far as we know, the only tests for peptides or related systems,
have been performed using a small number of conformers, and this is the first
time that this potentially very economical approximation is tested in full
PESs. In order to achieve these goals, all data sets have been compared and
analyzed in a way which captures the nearness concept in the space of MCs.

semi-stable activity patterns, as they are observed in cortical neural activity
patterns. We propose and discuss a general mechanism allowing for an adiabatic
continuation between attractor networks and a specific adjoined transient-state
network, which is strictly dissipative. Dynamical systems with transient states
retain functionality when their working point is autoregulated; avoiding
prolonged periods of stasis or drifting into a regime of rapid fluctuations. We
show, within a continuous-time neural network model, that a single local
updating rule for online learning allows simultaneously (i) for information
storage via unsupervised Hebbian-type learning, (ii) for adaptive regulation of
the working point and (iii) for the suppression of runaway synaptic growth.
Simulation results are presented; the spontaneous breaking of time-reversal
symmetry and link symmetry are discussed.

is turned on or off by changes in the concentration of a transcription factor
(TF). We use recent data on noise levels in gene expression to show that it
should be possible to transmit much more than just one regulatory bit.
Realizing this optimal information capacity would require that the dynamic
range of TF concentrations used by the cell, the input/output relation of the
regulatory module, and the noise levels of binding and transcription satisfy
certain matching relations. This parameter-free prediction is in good agreement
with recent experiments on the Bicoid/Hunchback system in the early Drosophila
embryo, and this system achieves ~90% of its theoretical maximum information
transmission.

(DPD) that allows the study of the collective dynamics of complex chemical and
structural systems in a spatially resolved manner with a combinatorially
complex variety of different system constituents. We show that introducing
multipolar interactions between particles leads to extended membrane structures

two-dimensional self-organizing dynamic reaction environment for kinetic
studies in the context of cell biology. We further show that the emergent
dynamics of extended membrane bound objects is in accordance with scaling laws
imposed by physics.

and biochemical networks is of critical importance in biology today. We sought
to develop a mathematical approach to this problem using, as a test case, one
of the most well-studied and clinically important signaling networks in biology
today, the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) driven signaling cascade.
More specifically, we suggest a method, augmented sparse reconstruction, for
the identification of links among nodes of ordinary differential equation (ODE)
networks from a small set of trajectories with different initial conditions.
Our method builds a system of representation by using a collection of integrals
of all given trajectories and by attenuating block of terms in the
representation itself. The system of representation is then augmented with
random vectors, and minimization of the 1-norm is used to find sparse
representations for the dynamical interactions of each node. Augmentation by
random vectors is crucial, since sparsity alone is not able to handle the large
error-in-variables in the representation. Augmented sparse reconstruction
allows to consider potentially very large spaces of models and it is able to
detect with high accuracy the few relevant links among nodes, even when
moderate noise is added to the measured trajectories. After showing the
performance of our method on a model of the EGFR protein network, we sketch
briefly the potential future therapeutic applications of this approach.

Accepted for publication in PLoS ONE</comments><journal-ref>PLoS ONE 2(6): e547 (2007)</journal-ref><doi>10.1371/journal.pone.0000547</doi><abstract>  Selective control in a population is the ability to control a member of the
population while leaving the other members relatively unaffected. The concept
of selective control is developed using cell death or apoptosis in
heterogeneous cell populations as an example. Apoptosis signaling in
heterogeneous cells is described by an ensemble of gene networks with identical
topology but different link strengths. Selective control depends on the
statistics of signaling in the ensemble of networks and we analyse the effects
of superposition, non-linearity and feedback on these statistics. Parallel
pathways promote normal statistics while series pathways promote skew
distributions which in the most extreme cases become log-normal. We also show
that feedback and non-linearity can produce bimodal signaling statistics, as
can discreteness and non-linearity. Two methods for optimizing selective
control are presented. The first is an exhaustive search method and the second
is a linear programming based approach. Though control of a single gene in the
signaling network yields little selectivity, control of a few genes typically
yields higher levels of selectivity. The statistics of gene combinations
susceptible to selective control is studied and is used to identify general
control strategies. We found that selectivity is promoted by acting on the
least sensitive nodes in the case of weak populations, while selective control
of robust populations is optimized through perturbations of more sensitive
nodes. High throughput experiments with heterogeneous cell lines could be
designed in an analogous manner, with the further possibility of incorporating
the selectivity optimization process into a closed-loop control system.

two-dimensional) continua and its applications in bio- and nano-structures.
First, the curve and surface theory, as the geometric representation of the
low-dimensional continua, is briefly described through Cartan moving frame
method. The elastic theory of Kirchhoff rod, Helfrich rod, bending-soften rod,
fluid membrane, and solid shell is revisited. Secondly, the application and
availability of the elastic theory of low-dimensional continua in
bio-structures, including short DNA rings, lipid membranes, and cell membranes,
are discussed. The kink stability of short DNA rings is addressed by using the
theory of Kirchhoff rod, Helfrich rod, and bending-soften rod. The lipid
membranes obey the theory of fluid membrane. A cell membrane is simplified as a
composite shell of lipid bilayer and membrane skeleton, which is a little
similar to the solid shell. It is found that the membrane skeleton enhances
highly the mechanical stability of cell membranes. Thirdly, the application and
availability of the elastic theory of low-dimensional continua in
nano-structures, including graphene and carbon nanotubes, are discussed. A
revised Lenosky lattice model is proposed based on the local density
approximation. Its continuum form up to the second order terms of curvatures
and strains is the same as the free energy of 2D solid shells. Several typical
mechanical properties of carbon nanotubes are revisited and investigated based
on this continuum form. It is possible to avoid introducing the controversial
concepts, the Young's modulus and thickness of graphene and single-walled
carbon nanotubes, with this continuum form.

Hodgkin-Huxley-type point neuron, as well as by the leaky integrate-and-fire
model. In the binding neuron, the trace of an input is remembered for a fixed
period of time after which it disappears completely. This is in the contrast
with the above two models, where the postsynaptic potentials decay
exponentially and can be forgotten only after triggering. The finiteness of
memory in the binding neuron allows one to construct fast recurrent networks
for computer modeling. Recently, the finiteness is utilized for exact
mathematical description of the output stochastic process if the binding neuron
is driven with the Poissonian input stream. In this paper, the simplest
networking is considered for binding neuron. Namely, it is expected that every
output spike of single neuron is immediately fed into its input. For this
construction, externally fed with Poissonian stream, the output stream is
characterized in terms of interspike interval probability density distribution
if the binding neuron has threshold 2. For higher thresholds, the distribution
is calculated numerically. The distributions are compared with those found for
binding neuron without feedback, and for leaky integrator. Sample distributions
for leaky integrator with feedback are calculated numerically as well. It is
oncluded that even the simplest networking can radically alter spikng
statistics. Information condensation at the level of single neuron is
discussed.

with the aim of investigating the interplay of spatial disorder and
nonlinearity. We show that spontaneous localization of energy occurs
generically and is a site-dependent process. Localized modes of nonlinear
origin form spontaneously in the stiffest parts of the structure and display
site-dependent activation energies. Our results provide a straightforward way
for understanding the recently discovered link between protein local stiffness
and enzymatic activity. They strongly suggest that nonlinear phenomena may play
an important role in enzyme function, allowing for energy storage during the
catalytic process.

acteristic properties that on one hand are shared by structures from a
particular realm, like gene regulation, protein-protein interaction or neu- ral

structures. We introduce and apply a general method, based on the spectrum of
the normalized graph Laplacian, that yields repre- sentations, the spectral
plots, that allow us to find and visualize such properties systematically. We
present such visualizations for a wide range of biological networks and compare
them with those for networks derived from theoretical schemes. The differences
that we find are quite striking and suggest that the search for universal
properties of biological networks should be complemented by an understanding of
more specific features of biological organization principles at different
scales.

  EVALUATION OF SINGLE-MOLECULE SIGNALS, (October, 2008)</journal-ref><abstract>  Single molecule data made of on and off events are ubiquitous. Famous
examples include enzyme turnover, probed via fluorescence, and opening and
closing of ion-channel, probed via the flux of ions. The data reflects the
dynamics in the underlying multi-substate on-off kinetic scheme (KS) of the
process, but the determination of the underlying KS is difficult, and sometimes
even impossible, due to the loss of information in the mapping of the
mutli-dimensional KS onto two dimensions. A way to deal with this problem
considers canonical (unique) forms. (Unique canonical form is constructed from
an infinitely long trajectory, but many KSs.) Here we introduce canonical forms
of reduced dimensions that can handle any KS (i.e. also KSs with symmetry and
irreversible transitions). We give the mapping of KSs into reduced dimensions
forms, which is based on topology of KSs, and the tools for extracting the
reduced dimensions form from finite data. The canonical forms of reduced
dimensions constitute a powerful tool in discriminating between KSs.

one-dimensional (1D) chain of L states. The recursion relation relates the n

has n independent coefficients that obey a universal formula. The z transform
of the recursion relation straightforwardly gives the generating function for
path PDFs, from which we obtain the Green's function of the random walk, and
derive an explicit expression for any path PDF of the random walk. These
expressions give the most detailed description of arbitrarily inhomogeneous
semi-Markovian random walks in 1D.

engineering the structure and dynamics of biochemical networks is high.
Recently an algorithm for reverse engineering of biochemical networks was
developed by Laubenbacher and Stigler. It is a top-down approach using time
discrete dynamical systems. One of its key steps includes the choice of a term
order. The aim of this paper is to identify minimal requirements on data sets
to be used with this algorithm and to characterize optimal data sets. We found
minimal requirements on a data set based on how many terms the functions to be
reverse engineered display. Furthermore, we identified optimal data sets, which
we characterized using a geometric property called "general position".
Moreover, we developed a constructive method to generate optimal data sets,
provided a codimensional condition is fulfilled. In addition, we present a
generalization of their algorithm that does not depend on the choice of a term
order. For this method we derived a formula for the probability of finding the
correct model, provided the data set used is optimal. We analyzed the
asymptotic behavior of the probability formula for a growing number of
variables n (i.e. interacting chemicals). Unfortunately, this formula converges
to zero as fast as r^(q^n), where q is a natural number and 0&lt;r&lt;1. Therefore,
even if an optimal data set is used and the restrictions in using term orders
are overcome, the reverse engineering problem remains unfeasible, unless
prodigious amounts of data are available. Such large data sets are
experimentally impossible to generate with today's technologies.

transport between the cytoplasm and the nucleoplasm. Two models have been
suggested for the plug of the NPC. They are (i) it is a reversible hydrogel or
(ii) it is a polymer brush. We propose a mesoscopic model for the transport of
a protein through the plug, that is general enough to cover both. The protein
stretches the plug and creates a local deformation. The bubble so created
(prtoein+deformation) executes random walk in the plug. We find that for faster
relaxation of the gel, the diffusion of the bubble is greater. Further, on
using parameters appropriate for the brush, we find that the diffusion
coefficient is much lower. Hence the gel model seems to be more likely
explanation for the workings of the plug.

one at a time. In a small range of forces, an RNA molecule can hop between the
folded and the unfolded state with force-dependent kinetic rates. Here, we
introduce a mesoscopic model to analyze the hopping kinetics of RNA hairpins in
an optical tweezers setup. The model includes different elements of the
experimental setup (beads, handles and RNA sequence) and limitations of the
instrument (time lag of the force-feedback mechanism and finite bandwidth of
data acquisition). We investigated the influence of the instrument on the
measured hopping rates. Results from the model are in good agreement with the
experiments reported in the companion article (1). The comparison between
theory and experiments allowed us to infer the values of the intrinsic
molecular rates of the RNA hairpin alone and to search for the optimal
experimental conditions to do the measurements. We conclude that long handles
and soft laser traps represent the best conditions to extract rate estimates
that are closest to the intrinsic molecular rates. The methodology and
rationale presented here can be applied to other experimental setups and other
molecules.

statistical association and significance estimates in contingency tables, a
type of categorical data analysis known in this field as enrichment (also
over-representation or enhancement) analysis. In spite of efforts to create
probabilistic annotations, especially in the Gene Ontology context, or to deal
with uncertainty in high throughput-based datasets, current enrichment methods
largely ignore this probabilistic information since they are mainly based on
variants of the Fisher Exact Test. We developed an open-source R package to
deal with probabilistic categorical data analysis, ProbCD, that does not
require a static contingency table. The contingency table for the enrichment
problem is built using the expectation of a Bernoulli Scheme stochastic process
given the categorization probabilities. An on-line interface was created to
allow usage by non-programmers and is available at:
http://xerad.systemsbiology.net/ProbCD/ . We present an analysis framework and
software tools to address the issue of uncertainty in categorical data
analysis. In particular, concerning the enrichment analysis, ProbCD can
accommodate: (i) the stochastic nature of the high-throughput experimental
techniques and (ii) probabilistic gene annotation.

cell-matrix adhesion, mechanical force triggers signaling through the
Rho-pathway, which leads to structural reinforcement and increased
contractility in the actin cytoskeleton. The resulting force acts back to the
sites of adhesion, resulting in a positive feedback loop for mature adhesion.
Here we model this biochemical-mechanical feedback loop for the special case
when the actin cytoskeleton is organized in stress fibers, which are
contractile bundles of actin filaments. Activation of myosin II molecular
motors through the Rho-pathway is described by a system of reaction-diffusion
equations, which are coupled into a viscoelastic model for a contractile actin
bundle. We find strong spatial gradients in the activation of contractility and
in the corresponding deformation pattern of the stress fiber, in good agreement
with experimental findings.

formation of a homogeneous pearled structure is achieved by consequent pearling
of an initial cylindrical tube from the tip. For high enough concentration of
anchors, we show theoretically that the homogeneous pearled shape is
energetically less favorable than an inhomogeneous one, with a large sphere
connected to an array of smaller spheres.

it. We study the effect of sharing a reward among cooperators in the most
stringent form of social dilemma, namely the Prisoner's Dilemma. Specifically,
for a group of players that collect payoffs by playing a pairwise Prisoner's
Dilemma game with their partners, we consider an external entity that
distributes a fixed reward equally among all cooperators. Thus, individuals
confront a new dilemma: on the one hand, they may be inclined to choose the
shared reward despite the possibility of being exploited by defectors; on the
other hand, if too many players do that, cooperators will obtain a poor reward
and defectors will outperform them. By appropriately tuning the amount to be
shared a vast variety of scenarios arises, including traditional ones in the
study of cooperation as well as more complex situations where unexpected
behavior can occur. We provide a complete classification of the equilibria of
the $n$-player game as well as of its evolutionary dynamics.

Considering nucleotides, codons, DNA and RNA sequences, amino acids, and
proteins as information systems, we have formulated the corresponding p-adic
formalisms for their investigations. Each of these systems has its
characteristic prime number used for construction of the related information
space. Relevance of this approach is illustrated by some examples. In
particular, it is shown that degeneration of the genetic code is a p-adic
phenomenon. We have also put forward a hypothesis on evolution of the genetic
code assuming that primitive code was based on single nucleotides and
chronologically first four amino acids. This formalism of p-adic genomic
information systems can be implemented in computer programs and applied to
various concrete cases.

of magnitude faster than predicted by the Smoluchowski three-dimensional
diffusion rate. One of the mechanisms proposed to resolve this discrepancy is
termed "intersegment transfer". Many proteins have two DNA binding sites and
can transfer from one DNA segment to another without dissociation to water. We
calculate the target search rate for such proteins in a dense globular DNA,
taking into account intersegment transfer working in conjunction with DNA
motion and protein sliding along DNA. We show that intersegment transfer plays
a very important role in cases where the protein spends most of its time
adsorbed on DNA.

behavior of cells. Recent high-throughput genomic studies of cancer cells have
shown that the mutational landscape of cancer is complex and that individual
cancers may evolve through mutations in as many as 20 different
cancer-associated genes. We use data published by Sjoblom et al. (2006) to
develop a new mathematical model for the somatic evolution of colorectal
cancers. We employ the Wright-Fisher process for exploring the basic parameters
of this evolutionary process and derive an analytical approximation for the
expected waiting time to the cancer phenotype. Our results highlight the
relative importance of selection over both the size of the cell population at
risk and the mutation rate. The model predicts that the observed genetic
diversity of cancer genomes can arise under a normal mutation rate if the
average selective advantage per mutation is on the order of 1%. Increased
mutation rates due to genetic instability would allow even smaller selective
advantages during tumorigenesis. The complexity of cancer progression thus can
be understood as the result of multiple sequential mutations, each of which has
a relatively small but positive effect on net cell growth.

Phys. 10 (2008) 015011</report-no><abstract>  Eytan and Marom recently showed that the spontaneous burst activity of rat
neuron cultures includes `first to fire' cells that consistently fire earlier
than others. Here we analyze the behavior of these neurons in long term
recordings of spontaneous activity of rat hippocampal and rat cortical neuron
cultures from three different laboratories. We identify precursor events that
may either subside (`small events') or can lead to a full-blown burst
(`pre-bursts'). We find that the activation in the pre-burst typically has a
first neuron (`leader'), followed by a localized response in its neighborhood.
Locality is diminished in the bursts themselves. The long term dynamics of the
leaders is relatively robust, evolving with a half-life of 23-34 hours.
Stimulation of the culture can temporarily alter the leader distribution, but
it returns to the previous distribution within about 1 hour. We show that the
leaders carry information about the identity of the burst, as measured by the
signature of the number of spikes per neuron in a burst. The number of spikes
from leaders in the first few spikes of a precursor event is furthermore shown
to be predictive with regard to the transition into a burst (pre-burst versus
small event). We conclude that the leaders play a r\^ole in the development of
the bursts, and conjecture that they are part of an underlying sub-network that
is excited first and then act as nucleation centers for the burst.

chromatin fibers, we show that fibers submitted to large positive torsion
transiently trap positive turns, at a rate of one turn per nucleosome. A
comparison with the response of fibers of tetrasomes (the (H3-H4)2 tetramer
bound with ~50 bp of DNA) obtained by depletion of H2A-H2B dimers, suggests
that the trapping reflects a nucleosome chiral transition to a metastable form
built on the previously documented righthanded tetrasome. In view of its low
energy, &lt;8 kT, we propose this transition is physiologically relevant and
serves to break the docking of the dimers on the tetramer which in the absence
of other factors exerts a strong block against elongation of transcription by
the main RNA polymerase.

two small helical proteins, the B domain of protein A and the Villin headpiece.
Folding kinetics are studied by performing a large number of ab initio Monte
Carlo folding simulations using a single transferable all-atom potential. Using
these trajectories, we examine the relaxation behavior, secondary structure
formation, and transition-state ensembles (TSEs) of the two proteins and
compare our results with experimental data and previous computational studies.
To obtain a detailed structural information on the folding dynamics viewed as
an ensemble process, we perform a clustering analysis procedure based on graph
theory. Moreover, rigorous pfold analysis is used to obtain representative
samples of the TSEs and a good quantitative agreement between experimental and
simulated Fi-values is obtained for protein A. Fi-values for Villin are also
obtained and left as predictions to be tested by future experiments. Our
analysis shows that two-helix hairpin is a common partially stable structural
motif that gets formed prior to entering the TSE in the studied proteins. These
results together with our earlier study of Engrailed Homeodomain and recent
experimental studies provide a comprehensive, atomic-level picture of folding
mechanics of three-helix bundle proteins.

dynamics of individual MreB protofilaments with an elastic model of
protofilament bundles buckled into helical configurations. We use variational
techniques and stochastic simulations to relate the pitch of the MreB helix,
the total abundance of MreB, and the number of protofilaments. By comparing our
simulations with mean-field calculations, we find that stochastic fluctuations
are significant. We examine the quasi-static evolution of the helical pitch
with cell growth, as well as timescales of helix turnover and denovo
establishment. We find that while the body of a polarized MreB helix treadmills
towards its slow-growing end, the fast-growing tips of laterally associated
protofilaments move towards the opposite fast-growing end of the MreB helix.
This offers a possible mechanism for targeted polar localization without
cytoplasmic motor proteins.

basal ganglia recordings, we found sharp peaks in the spectrum at 20 and 70 Hz.
The algorithm is also compared to the conventional fast Fourier transform and
circular statistics techniques using computer generated model data, and is
found to be comparable to or better than fast Fourier transform in test cases.
Circular statistics performed poorly in our tests.

a specific binding site on the DNA. The specific binding site may consist of
just a few base pairs while the DNA is usually several millions of base pairs
long. How does the protein search for the target site? What is the most
efficient mechanism for a successful search? Motivated by these fundamental
questions on intracellular biological processes, we have developed a model for
searching a specific site on a model DNA by a single protein. We have made a
comparative quantitative study of the efficiencies of sliding, inter-segmental
hoppings and detachment/re-attachments of the particle during its search for
the specific site on the DNA. We also introduce some new quantitative measures
of {\it efficiency} of a search process by defining a relevant quantity, which
can be measured in {\it in-vitro} experiments.

the level of cooperation extensively varies with the topology of agent networks
in the widely used models of repeated games. Here we show that cooperation
remains rather stable by applying the reinforcement learning strategy adoption
rule, Q-learning on a variety of random, regular, small-word, scale-free and
modular network models in repeated, multi-agent Prisoners Dilemma and Hawk-Dove
games. Furthermore, we found that using the above model systems other long-term
learning strategy adoption rules also promote cooperation, while introducing a
low level of noise (as a model of innovation) to the strategy adoption rules
makes the level of cooperation less dependent on the actual network topology.
Our results demonstrate that long-term learning and random elements in the
strategy adoption rules, when acting together, extend the range of network
topologies enabling the development of cooperation at a wider range of costs
and temptations. These results suggest that a balanced duo of learning and
innovation may help to preserve cooperation during the re-organization of
real-world networks, and may play a prominent role in the evolution of
self-organizing, complex systems.

efficient characterization of the whole set of stable fluxes compatible with
the metabolic constraints. The algorithm, based on the well-known Bethe
approximation, allows the computation in polynomial time of the volume of a non
full-dimensional convex polytope in high dimensions. The result of our
algorithm match closely the prediction of Monte Carlo based estimations of the
flux distributions of the Red Blood Cell metabolic network but in incomparably
shorter time. We also analyze the statistical properties of the average fluxes
of the reactions in the E-Coli metabolic network and finally to test the effect
of gene knock-outs on the size of the solution space of the E-Coli central

Rev. E 78, 011910 (2008)</journal-ref><doi>10.1103/PhysRevE.78.011910</doi><abstract>  Changes in a cell's external or internal conditions are usually reflected in
the concentrations of the relevant transcription factors. These proteins in
turn modulate the expression levels of the genes under their control and
sometimes need to perform non-trivial computations that integrate several
inputs and affect multiple genes. At the same time, the activities of the
regulated genes would fluctuate even if the inputs were held fixed, as a
consequence of the intrinsic noise in the system, and such noise must
fundamentally limit the reliability of any genetic computation. Here we use
information theory to formalize the notion of information transmission in
simple genetic regulatory elements in the presence of physically realistic
noise sources. The dependence of this "channel capacity" on noise parameters,
cooperativity and cost of making signaling molecules is explored
systematically. We find that, at least in principle, capacities higher than one
bit should be achievable and that consequently genetic regulation is not
limited the use of binary, or "on-off", components.

(2008) 2:2</journal-ref><doi>10.3389/neuro.10.002.2008</doi><abstract>  We present a mathematical analysis of a networks with Integrate-and-Fire
neurons and adaptive conductances. Taking into account the realistic fact that
the spike time is only known within some \textit{finite} precision, we propose
a model where spikes are effective at times multiple of a characteristic time
scale $\delta$, where $\delta$ can be \textit{arbitrary} small (in particular,
well beyond the numerical precision). We make a complete mathematical
characterization of the model-dynamics and obtain the following results. The
asymptotic dynamics is composed by finitely many stable periodic orbits, whose
number and period can be arbitrary large and can diverge in a region of the
synaptic weights space, traditionally called the "edge of chaos", a notion
mathematically well defined in the present paper. Furthermore, except at the
edge of chaos, there is a one-to-one correspondence between the membrane
potential trajectories and the raster plot. This shows that the neural code is
entirely "in the spikes" in this case. As a key tool, we introduce an order
parameter, easy to compute numerically, and closely related to a natural notion
of entropy, providing a relevant characterization of the computational
capabilities of the network. This allows us to compare the computational
capabilities of leaky and Integrate-and-Fire models and conductance based
models. The present study considers networks with constant input, and without
time-dependent plasticity, but the framework has been designed for both
extensions.

stimulus. The frustration due to the competition between the neuron's natural
firing period and that of the oscillatory rhythm, leads to a rich structure of
asymptotic phase locking patterns and ordering dynamics. The phase transitions
between these states can be classified as either tangent or discontinuous
bifurcations, each with its own characteristic scaling laws. The discontinuous
bifurcations exhibit a new kind of phase transition that may be viewed as
intermediate between continuous and first order, while tangent bifurcations
behave like continuous transitions with a diverging coherence scale.

fragments, the exons, separated by non-coding DNA stretches, the introns.
Prokaryotes do not have introns in their genome. We report the calculations of
stability domains of actin genes for various organisms in the animal, plant and
fungi kingdoms. Actin genes have been chosen because they have been highly
conserved during evolution. In these genes all introns were removed so as to
mimic ancient genes at the time of the early eukaryotic development, i.e.
before introns insertion. Common stability boundaries are found in evolutionary
distant organisms, which implies that these boundaries date from the early
origin of eukaryotes. In general boundaries correspond with introns positions
of vertebrates and other animals actins, but not much for plants and fungi. The
sharpest boundary is found in a locus where fungi, algae and animals have
introns in positions separated by one nucleotide only, which identifies a
hot-spot for insertion. These results suggest that some introns may have been
incorporated into the genomes through a thermodynamic driven mechanism, in
agreement with previous observations on human genes. They also suggest a
different mechanism for introns insertion in plants and animals.

of natural systems including cardiac tissue. Propagation of excitation waves in
this medium results in the formation of characteristic patterns such as
rotating spiral waves. Instabilities in these structures may lead to
spatiotemporal chaos through spiral turbulence, which has been linked to
clinically diagnosed conditions such as cardiac fibrillation. Usual methods for
controlling such phenomena involve very large amplitude perturbations and have
several drawbacks. There have been several recent attempts to develop
low-amplitude control procedures for spatiotemporal chaos in excitable media
which are reviewed in this paper. The control schemes have been broadly
classified by us into three types: (i) global, (ii) non-global
spatially-extended and (iii) local, depending on the way the control signal is
applied, and we discuss the merits and drawbacks for each.

disease spread within a social setting. These components are, the underlying
contact structure among individuals that determines the pattern of disease
transmission; and the evolution of this pattern over time. Mathematical models
of infectious diseases, which are in principle analytically tractable, use two
general approaches to incorporate these elements. The first approach, generally
known as compartmental modeling, addresses the time evolution of disease spread
at the expense of simplifying the pattern of transmission. On the other hand,
the second approach uses network theory to incorporate detailed information
pertaining to the underlying contact structure among individuals. However,
while providing accurate estimates on the final size of outbreaks/epidemics,
this approach, in its current formalism, disregards the progression of time
during outbreaks. So far, the only alternative that enables the integration of
both aspects of disease spread simultaneously has been to abandon the
analytical approach and rely on computer simulations. We offer a new analytical
framework based on percolation theory, which incorporates both the complexity
of contact network structure and the time progression of disease spread.
Furthermore, we demonstrate that this framework is equally effective on finite-
and "infinite"-size networks. Application of this formalism is not limited to
disease spread; it can be equally applied to similar percolation phenomena on
networks in other areas in science and technology.

Artificial Life research [1]. It is generally agreed that complexity has
increased in our universe, giving way to life, multi-cellularity, societies,
and systems of higher complexities. However, the mechanisms behind the
complexification and its relation to evolution are not well understood.
Moreover complexification can be used to mean different things in different
contexts. For example, complexification has been interpreted as a process of
diversification between evolving units [2] or as a scaling process related to
the idea of transitions between different levels of complexity [7].
Understanding the difference or overlap between the mechanisms involved in both
situations is mandatory to create acceptable synthetic models of the process,
as is required in Artificial Life research. (...)

biological systems, including top-down as well as same-level and bottom-up
causation, thus enabling the top levels to be causally efficacious in their own

signs are introduced here and the concepts of information control and
functional equivalence classes in those systems are rigorously defined and used
to characterise when top down causation by feedback control happens, in a way
that is testable. The causally significant elements we consider are equivalence
classes of lower level processes, realised in biological systems through
different operations having the same outcome within the context of information
control and networks.

analyze the results of gene perturbation screens. NEMs explore noisy subset
relations between the high-dimensional outputs of phenotyping studies, e.g. the
effects showing in gene expression profiles or as morphological features of the
perturbed cell.
  In this paper we expand the statistical basis of NEMs in four directions:
First, we derive a new formula for the likelihood function of a NEM, which
generalizes previous results for binary data. Second, we prove model
identifiability under mild assumptions. Third, we show that the new formulation
of the likelihood allows to efficiently traverse model space. Fourth, we
incorporate prior knowledge and an automated variable selection criterion to
decrease the influence of noise in the data.

Markov invariants. Markov invariants are group invariant polynomials and are
distinct from what is known in the literature as phylogenetic invariants,
although we establish a commonality in some special cases. We show that the
simplest Markov invariant forms the foundation of the Log-Det distance measure.
We take as our primary tool group representation theory, and show that it
provides a general framework for analysing Markov processes on trees. From this
algebraic perspective, the inherent symmetries of these processes become
apparent, and focusing on plethysms, we are able to define Markov invariants
and give existence proofs. We give an explicit technique for constructing the
invariants, valid for any number of character states and taxa. For phylogenetic
trees with three and four leaves, we demonstrate that the corresponding Markov
invariants can be fruitfully exploited in applied phylogenetic studies.

essential for an integral picture of evolution. This paper proposes that the
division of internal evolution into DNA/RNA pattern formation (genotype) and
protein functional action (phenotype) resolves a universal conflict between
fitness and evolvability. Specifically, this paper explains how this universal
conflict drove the emergence of genotype-phenotype division, why this labor
division is responsible for the extraordinary complexity of life, and how the
specific ways of genotype-phenotype mapping in the labor division determine the
paths and forms of evolution and development.

Rev. E 79, 051901 (2009)</journal-ref><doi>10.1103/PhysRevE.79.051901</doi><abstract>  The precision of biochemical signaling is limited by randomness in the
diffusive arrival of molecules at their targets. For proteins binding to the
specific sites on the DNA and regulating transcription, the ability of the
proteins to diffuse in one dimension by sliding along the length of the DNA, in
addition to their diffusion in bulk solution, would seem to generate a larger
target for DNA binding, consequently reducing the noise in the occupancy of the
regulatory site. Here we show that this effect is largely cancelled by the
enhanced temporal correlations in one dimensional diffusion. With realistic
parameters, sliding along DNA has surprisingly little effect on the physical
limits to the precision of transcriptional regulation.

inter- and intracellular environment, can generate significant cell-to-cell
variability of protein levels in clonal populations. We present a theoretical
framework, based on stochastic processes, to quantify the different sources of
gene expression noise taking cell division explicitly into account. Analytical,
time-dependent solutions for the noise contributions arising from the major
steps involved in protein synthesis are derived. The analysis shows that the
induction level of the activator or transcription factor is crucial for the
characteristic signature of the dominant source of gene expression noise and
thus bridges the gap between seemingly contradictory experimental results.
Furthermore, on the basis of experimentally measured cell distributions, our
simulations suggest that transcription factor binding and promoter activation
can be modelled independently of each other with sufficient accuracy.

This allows us to extract the distribution of the number of initially closed

agreement with earlier results from single bond experiments. Our analysis shows
that the peaks in the measured histograms are not simple multiples of the
single bond values, but follow from a superposition procedure which generates
different peak positions.

transformations specified by reaction rules, which can be viewed as generators
of chemical reactions, or equivalently, definitions of reaction classes. A rule
identifies the molecular components involved in a transformation, how these
components change, conditions that affect whether a transformation occurs, and
a rate law. The computational cost of the method, unlike conventional
simulation approaches, is independent of the number of possible reactions,
which need not be specified in advance or explicitly generated in a simulation.
To demonstrate the method, we apply it to study the kinetics of multivalent
ligand-receptor interactions. We expect the method will be useful for studying
cellular signaling systems and other physical systems involving aggregation
phenomena.

in a wide range of disciplines, as chemical catalysis, biological evolution,
social and economic systems. The dynamics of those systems can be formulated
within the unifying framework of evolutionary game theory. However it is not a
priori clear which mathematical description is appropriate when populations are
not infinitely large. Whereas the replicator equation approach describes the
infinite population size limit by deterministic differential equations, in
finite populations the dynamics is inherently stochastic which can lead to new
effects. Recently, an explicit mean-field description in the form of a
Fokker-Planck equation was derived for frequency-dependent selection in finite
populations based on microscopic processes. In asymmetric conflicts between two
populations with a cyclic dominance, a finite-size dependent drift reversal was
demonstrated, depending on the underlying microscopic process of the
evolutionary update. Cyclic dynamics appears widely in biological coevolution,
be it within a homogeneous population, or be it between disjunct populations as
female and male. Here explicit analytic address is given and the average drift
is calculated for the frequency-dependent Moran process and for different
pairwise comparison processes. It is explicitely shown that the drift reversal
cannot occur if the process relies on payoff differences between pairs of
individuals. Further, also a linear comparison with the average payoff does not
lead to a drift towards the internal fixed point. Hence the nonlinear
comparison function of the frequency-dependent Moran process, together with its
usage of nonlocal information via the average payoff, is the essential part of
the mechanism.

probability distribution of states taken on by this network. Despite the
intuition that the rules of English spelling are highly combinatorial (and
arbitrary), we find that maximum entropy models consistent with pairwise
correlations among letters provide a surprisingly good approximation to the
full statistics of four letter words, capturing ~92% of the multi-information
among letters and even "discovering" real words that were not represented in
the data from which the pairwise correlations were estimated. The maximum
entropy model defines an energy landscape on the space of possible words, and
local minima in this landscape account for nearly two-thirds of words used in
written English.

energies between atoms or residues, each of which is expressed as a product of
a conformation-dependent function (an element of a contact matrix, C-matrix)
and a sequence-dependent energy parameter (an element of a contact energy
matrix, E-matrix). Such pairwise interactions in proteins force native
C-matrices to be in a relationship as if the interactions are a Go-like
potential [N. Go, Annu. Rev. Biophys. Bioeng. 12. 183 (1983)] for the native
C-matrix, because the lowest bound of the total energy function is equal to the
total energy of the native conformation interacting in a Go-like pairwise
potential. This relationship between C- and E-matrices corresponds to (a) a
parallel relationship between the eigenvectors of the C- and E-matrices and a
linear relationship between their eigenvalues, and (b) a parallel relationship
between a contact number vector and the principal eigenvectors of the C- and
E-matrices; the E-matrix is expanded in a series of eigenspaces with an
additional constant term, which corresponds to a threshold of contact energy
that approximately separates native contacts from non-native ones. These
relationships are confirmed in 182 representatives from each family of the SCOP
database by examining inner products between the principal eigenvector of the
C-matrix, that of the E-matrix evaluated with a statistical contact potential,
and a contact number vector. In addition, the spectral representation of C- and
E-matrices reveals that pairwise residue-residue interactions, which depends
only on the types of interacting amino acids but not on other residues in a
protein, are insufficient and other interactions including residue
connectivities and steric hindrance are needed to make native structures the
unique lowest energy conformations.

that no classical or standard weak solution definition yields solvability of
the problem. We provide an appropriate definition of weak solution for the
problem, for which we show existence and uniqueness. The solution displays a
very distinctive structure and, for large time, we show convergence to a unique
stationary solution that turns out to be a singular measure supported at the
endpoints. An exponential rate of convergence to this steady state is also
proved.

the tandem duplication - random loss model of genome rearrangement, well-known
in evolutionary biology. In their model, the cost of one step of
duplication-loss of width k is $\alpha^k$ for $\alpha =1$ or $\alpha &gt;=2 $. In
this paper, we study a variant of this model, where the cost of one step of
width $k$ is 1 if $k &lt;= K$ and $\infty$ if $k &gt; K$, for any value of the
parameter $K in N$. We first show that permutations obtained after $p$ steps of
width $K$ define classes of pattern-avoiding permutations. We also compute the
numbers of duplication-loss steps of width $K$ necessary and sufficient to
obtain any permutation of $S_n$, in the worst case and on average. In this
second part, we may also consider the case $K=K(n)$, a function of the size $n$
of the permutation on which the duplication-loss operations are performed.

generate the impedance spectra of the rat OR I7 in the native and activated
state and analyze their differences. In this way, we connect the protein
morphological transformation, caused by the sensing action, with its change of
electrical impedance. The results are compared with those obtained by studying
the best known protein of the GPCR family: bovine rhodopsin. Our investigations
indicate that a change in morphology goes with a change in impedance spectrum
mostly associated with a decrease of the static impedance up to about 60 % of
the initial value, in qualitative agreement with existing experiments on rat OR
I7. The predictiveness of the model is tested successfully for the case of
recent experiments on bacteriorhodopsin. The present results point to a
promising development of a new class of nanobiosensors based on the electrical
properties of GPCR and other sensing proteins.

trajectory and mean extinction time of the disease numerically and uncover a
non-monotone, spiral path to extinction of a disease. We also obtain analytical
results close to a bifurcation point, where the problem is described by a
Hamiltonian previously identified in one-species population models.

reconstructs a phylogenetic tree and ancestral sequences from extant data
(sequences at the leaves). The tree and ancestral sequences maximize the
probability of observing the given data under a Markov model of sequence
evolution, in which branch lengths are also optimized but constrained to take
the same value on any edge across all sequence sites. AML differs from the more
usual form of maximum likelihood (ML) in phylogenetics because ML averages over
all possible ancestral sequences. ML has long been known to be statistically
consistent -- that is, it converges on the correct tree with probability
approaching 1 as the sequence length grows. However, the statistical
consistency of AML has not been formally determined, despite informal remarks
in a literature that dates back 20 years. In this short note we prove a general
result that implies that AML is statistically inconsistent. In particular we
show that AML can `shrink' short edges in a tree, resulting in a tree that has
no internal resolution as the sequence length grows. Our results apply to any
number of taxa.

kinetic scheme (KS) from the statistical properties of a two-state trajectory.
However, the mapping of a KS into a two-state trajectory leads to the loss of
information about the KS, and so, in many cases, more than one KS can be
associated with the data. We recently showed that the optimal way to solve this
problem is to use canonical forms of reduced dimensions (RD). RD forms are
on-off networks with connections only between substates of different states,
where the connections can have non-exponential waiting time probability density
functions (WT-PDFs). In theory, only a single RD form can be associated with
the data. To utilize RD forms in the analysis of the data, a RD form should be
associated with the data. Here, we give a toolbox for building a RD form from a
finite two-state trajectory. The methods in the toolbox are based on known
statistical methods in data analysis, combined with statistical methods and
numerical algorithms designed specifically for the current problem. Our toolbox
is self-contained - it builds a mechanism based only on the information it
extracts from the data, and its implementation on the data is fast (analyzing a
10^6 cycle trajectory from a thirty-parameter mechanism takes a couple of hours
on a PC with a 2.66 GHz processor). The toolbox is automated and is freely
available for academic research upon electronic request.

very large and cohesive groups moving in three dimensions. Paradigmatic
examples are bird flocks, fish schools and insect swarms. However, because of
the sheer technical difficulty of obtaining 3D data, empirical studies
conducted to date have only considered loose groups of a few tens of animals.
Moreover, these studies were very seldom conducted in the field. Recently the
STARFLAG project achieved the 3D reconstruction of thousands of birds under
field conditions, thus opening the way to a new generation of quantitative
studies of collective animal behaviour. Here, we review the main technical
problems in 3D data collection of large animal groups and we outline some of
the methodological solutions adopted by the STARFLAG project. In particular, we
explain how to solve the stereoscopic correspondence - or matching - problem,
which was the major bottleneck of all 3D studies in the past.

between the theoretical predictions of numerical models and data coming from
empirical observations. To this aim it is important to develop methods of
three-dimensional (3D) analysis that are at the same time informative about the
structure of the group and suitable to empirical data. In fact, empirical data
are considerably noisier than numerical data, and they are subject to several
constraints. We review here the tools of analysis used by the STARFLAG project
to characterise the 3D structure of large flocks of starlings in the field. We
show how to avoid the most common pitfalls i the quantitative analysis of 3D
animal groups, with particular attention to the problem of the bias introduced
by the border of the group. By means of practical examples, we demonstrate that
neglecting border effects gives rise to artefacts when studying the 3D
structure of a group. Moreover, we show that mathematical rigour is essential
to distinguish important biological properties from trivial geometric features
of animal groups.

and technological implications. Although the self-assembly process is highly
efficient, aggregates not in the fibrillar form would also occur and it is
important to include these disordered species when discussing the thermodynamic
equilibrium behavior of the system. Here, we initiate such a task by
considering a mixture of monomeric proteins and the corresponding aggregates in
the disordered form (micelles) and in the fibrillar form (amyloid fibrils).
Starting with a model on the respective binding free energies for these
species, we calculate their concentrations at thermal equilibrium. We then
discuss how the incorporation of the disordered structure furthers our
understanding on the various amyloid promoting factors observed empirically,
and on the kinetics of fibrilization.

disease. Here we apply general methods of the theory of heterogeneous
populations to the simplest mathematical models in epidemiology. In particular,
an SIR (susceptible-infective-removed) model is formulated and analyzed for
different sources of heterogeneity. It is shown that a heterogeneous model can
be reduced to a homogeneous model with a nonlinear transmission function, which
is given in explicit form. The widely used power transmission function is
deduced from a heterogeneous model with the initial gamma-distribution of the
disease parameters. Therefore, a mechanistic derivation of the phenomenological
model, which mimics reality very well, is provided. The equation for the final
size of an epidemic for an arbitrary initial distribution is found. The
implications of population heterogeneity are discussed, in particular, it is
pointed out that usual moment-closure methods can lead to erroneous conclusions
if applied for the study of the long-term behavior of the model.

to modern biomedical research. Their accuracy strongly depends on effective
treatment of inter-gene correlation. Correlation is ordinarily accounted for in
terms of its effect on significance cut-offs. In this paper it is shown that
correlation can, in fact, be exploited {to share information across tests},
which, in turn, can increase statistical power.
  Results: Vastly and demonstrably improved differential analysis approaches
are the result of combining identifiability (the fact that in most microarray
data sets, a large proportion of genes can be identified a priori as
non-differential) with optimization criteria that incorporate correlation. As a
special case, we develop a method which builds upon the widely used two-sample
t-statistic based approach and uses the Mahalanobis distance as an optimality
criterion. Results on the prostate cancer data of Singh et al. (2002) suggest
that the proposed method outperforms all published approaches in terms of
statistical power.
  Availability: The proposed algorithm is implemented in MATLAB and in R. The
software, called Tellipsoid, and relevant data sets are available at

of species for a broad spectrum of resources. Recent studies have shown that
essentially two different outcomes are possible. Either the species surviving
competition are more or less uniformly distributed over the resource spectrum,
or their distribution is 'lumped' (or 'clumped'), consisting of clusters of
species with similar resource use that are separated by gaps in resource space.
Which of these outcomes will occur crucially depends on the competition kernel,
which reflects the shape of the resource utilization pattern of the competing
species. Most models considered in the literature assume a Gaussian competition
kernel. This is unfortunate, since predictions based on such a Gaussian
assumption are not robust. In fact, Gaussian kernels are a border case
scenario, and slight deviations from this function can lead to either uniform
or lumped species distributions. Here we illustrate the non-robustness of the
Gaussian assumption by simulating different implementations of the standard
competition model with constant carrying capacity. In this scenario, lumped
species distributions can come about by secondary ecological or evolutionary
mechanisms or by details of the numerical implementation of the model. We
analyze the origin of this sensitivity and discuss it in the context of recent
applications of the model.

is utilized in the theory of signal processing. The Kronecker family of the
genetic matrices is investigated, which is based on the genetic matrix [C A; U
G], where C, A, U, G are the letters of the genetic alphabet. This matrix in
the third Kronecker power is the (8*8)-matrix, which contains 64 triplets.
Peculiarities of the degeneracy of the vertebrate mitochondria genetic code are
reflected in the symmetrical black-and-white mosaic of this genetic
(8*8)-matrix. This mosaic matrix is connected algorithmically with Hadamard
matrices unexpectedly, which are famous in the theory of signal processing,
spectral analysis, quantum mechanics and quantum computers. A special
decomposition of numeric genetic matrices reveals their close relations with a
family of 8-dimensional hypercomplex numbers (not Cayley's octonions). Some
hypothesis and thoughts are formulated on the basis of these phenomenological
facts.

regulated transcription of thousands of genes. The elucidation of
transcriptional regulatory networks in thus needed to understand the cell's
working mechanism, and can for example be useful for the discovery of novel
therapeutic targets. Although several methods have been proposed to infer gene
regulatory networks from gene expression data, a recent comparison on a
large-scale benchmark experiment revealed that most current methods only
predict a limited number of known regulations at a reasonable precision level.
We propose SIRENE, a new method for the inference of gene regulatory networks
from a compendium of expression data. The method decomposes the problem of gene
regulatory network inference into a large number of local binary classification
problems, that focus on separating target genes from non-targets for each TF.
SIRENE is thus conceptually simple and computationally efficient. We test it on
a benchmark experiment aimed at predicting regulations in E. coli, and show
that it retrieves of the order of 6 times more known regulations than other
state-of-the-art inference methods.

reproduction rate) increases the extinction probability of an isolated
self-regulated stochastic population. Using a variant of the Verhulst logistic
model as an example, we combine the probability generating function technique
with an eikonal approximation to evaluate the exponentially large increase in
the extinction probability caused by the catastrophe. This quantity is given by
the eikonal action computed over "the optimal path" (instanton) of an effective
classical Hamiltonian system with a time-dependent Hamiltonian. For a general
catastrophe the eikonal equations can be solved numerically. For simple models
of catastrophic events analytic solutions can be obtained. One such solution
becomes quite simple close to the bifurcation point of the Verhulst model. The
eikonal results for the increase in the extinction probability caused by a
catastrophe agree well with numerical solutions of the master equation.

Part I:
  Connectivity and Applications to Genetic Switches</title><categories>q-bio.MN math.DS</categories><comments>To appear in Advances in Complex Systems</comments><license>http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/</license><abstract>  Time-continuous dynamical systems defined on graphs are often used to model
complex systems with many interacting components in a non-spatial context. In
the reverse sense attaching meaningful dynamics to given 'interaction diagrams'
is a central bottleneck problem in many application areas, especially in cell
biology where various such diagrams with different conventions describing
molecular regulation are presently in use. In most situations these diagrams
can only be interpreted by the use of both discrete and continuous variables
during the modelling process, corresponding to both deterministic and
stochastic hybrid dynamics. The conventions in genetics are well-known, and
therefore we use this field for illustration purposes. In [25] and [26] the
authors showed that with the help of a multi-scale analysis stochastic systems
with both continuous variables and finite state spaces can be approximated by
dynamical systems whose leading order time evolution is given by a combination
of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) and Markov chains. The leading order
term in these dynamical systems is called average dynamics and turns out to be
an adequate concept to analyse a class of simplified hybrid systems. Once the
dynamics is defifined the mutual interaction of both ODEs and Markov chains can
be analysed through the (reverse) introduction of the so called Interaction
Graph, a concept originally invented for time-continuous dynamical systems, see
[5]. Here we transfer this graph concept to the average dynamics, which itself
is introduced as an heuristic tool to construct models of reaction or contact
networks. The graphical concepts introduced form the basis for any subsequent
study of the qualitative properties of hybrid models in terms of connectivity
and (feedback) loop formation.

on the genetic matrix [C T; A G], where C, T, A, G are the letters of the
genetic alphabet. The matrix [C T; A G] in the second Kronecker power is the
(4*4)-matrix of 16 duplets. The matrix [C T; A G] in the third Kronecker power
is the (8*8)-matrix of 64 triplets. It is significant that peculiarities of the
degeneracy of the genetic code are reflected in the symmetrical black-and-white
mosaic of these genetic matrices. The article represents interesting
mathematical properties of these mosaic matrices, which are connected with
positional permutations inside duplets and triplets; with projector operators;
with unitary matrices and cyclic groups, etc. Fractal genetic nets are proposed
as a new effective tool to study long nucleotide sequences. Some results about
revealing new symmetry principles of long nucleotide sequences are described.

These models have
population dynamics at the species level, and mutations and extinction of
species are also included. The population dynamics are updated by difference
equations with stochastic noise terms that characterize population
fluctuations. The effects of the stochastic population fluctuations on
diversity and total population sizes on evolutionary time scales are studied.
In one model, species can make either predator-prey, mutualistic, or
competitive interactions, while the other model allows only predator-prey
interactions. When the noise in the population dynamics is strong enough, both
models show intermittent behavior and their power spectral densities show
approximate $1/f$ fluctuations. In the noiseless limit, the two models have
different power spectral densities. For the predator-prey model, $1/f^2$
fluctuations appears, indicating random-walk like behavior, while the other
model still shows $1/f$ noise. These results indicate that stochastic
population fluctuations may significantly affect long-time evolutionary
dynamics.

$1/\sqrt{N}$. Consequences and relations to some previous approaches are

manner in which concepts are used. We believe this stems from the view of
concepts as identifiers rather than bridges between mind and world that
participate in the generation of meaning. This paper summarizes the history and
current status of concepts research, and provides a non-technical summary of
work toward an ecological approach to concepts. We outline the rationale for
applying generalizations of formalisms originally developed for use in quantum
mechanics to the modeling of concepts, showing how it is because of the role of
context that deep structural similarities exist between the two. A concept is
defined not just in terms of exemplary states and their features or properties,
but also by the relational structures of these properties, and their
susceptibility to change under different contexts. The approach implies a view
of mind in which the union of perception and environment drives
conceptualization, forging a web of conceptual relations or 'ecology of mind'.

accumulates, diffuses, and gets applied in new contexts, generating cultural
analogs of phenomena observed in population genetics such as adaptation and
drift. It is therefore commonly thought that elements of culture evolve through
natural selection. However, natural selection was proposed to explain how
change accumulates despite lack of inheritance of acquired traits, as occurs
with template-mediated replication. It cannot accommodate a process with
significant retention of acquired or horizontally (e.g. socially) transmitted
traits. Moreover, elements of culture cannot be treated as discrete lineages
because they constantly interact and influence one another. It is proposed that
what evolves through culture is the mind; ideas and artifacts are merely
reflections of its current evolved state. Interacting minds transform (in part)
through through a non-Darwinian autopoietic process similar to that by which
early life evolved, involving not survival of the fittest but actualization of
their potential.

thermodynamically predicted RNA secondary structures are more abundant than
expected under a simple random null hypothesis. The detected hairpin structures
of RNA secondary structures are present both in coding and in noncoding regions
for the four groups of viruses categorized as dsDNA, dsRNA, ssDNA and ssRNA.
For all groups hairpin structures of RNA secondary structures are detected more
frequently than expected for a random null hypothesis in noncoding rather than
in coding regions. However, potential RNA secondary structures are also present
in coding regions of dsDNA group. In fact we detect evolutionary conserved RNA
secondary structures in conserved coding and noncoding regions of a large set
of complete genomes of dsDNA herpesviruses.

the life cycle of the Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV), which belongs to a
large family of enveloped RNA viruses, retroviruses. Unlike regular enveloped
viruses, retrovirus budding happens {\em concurrently} with the self-assembly
of retrovirus protein subunits (Gags) into spherical virus capsids on the cell
membrane. Led by this unique budding and assembly mechanism, we study the free
energy profile of retrovirus budding, taking into account of the Gag-Gag
attraction energy and the membrane elastic energy. We find that if the Gag-Gag
attraction is strong, budding always proceeds to completion. During early stage
of budding, the zenith angle of partial budded capsids, $\alpha$, increases
with time as $\alpha \propto t^{1/3}$. However, when Gag-Gag attraction is
weak, a metastable state of partial budding appears. The zenith angle of these
partially spherical capsids is given by
$\alpha_0\simeq(\tau^2/\kappa\sigma)^{1/4}$ in a linear approximation, where
$\kappa$ and $\sigma$ are the bending modulus and the surface tension of the
membrane, and $\tau$ is a line tension of the capsid proportional to the
strength of Gag-Gag attraction. Numerically, we find $\alpha_0&lt;0.3\pi$ without
any approximations. Using experimental parameters, we show that HIV budding and
assembly always proceed to completion in normal biological conditions. On the
other hand, by changing Gag-Gag interaction strength or membrane rigidity, it
is relatively easy to tune it back and forth between complete budding and
partial budding. Our model agrees reasonably well with experiments observing
partial budding of retroviruses including HIV.

biochemical AND gate. The obtained data are modeled within the rate-equation
approach, with the aim to map out the gate function and cast it in the language
of logic variables appropriate for analysis of Boolean logic for scalability.
In order to minimize "analog" noise, we consider a theoretical approach for
determining an optimal set for the process parameters to minimize "analog"
noise amplification for gate concatenation. We establish that under optimized
conditions, presently studied biochemical gates can be concatenated for up to
order 10 processing steps. Beyond that, new paradigms for avoiding noise
build-up will have to be developed. We offer a general discussion of the ideas
and possible future challenges for both experimental and theoretical research
for advancing scalable biochemical computing.

charge transport consisting of an increase of conductance is correlated to the
protein conformational change. A theoretical model based on a map of the
protein tertiary structure into a resistor network is implemented to account
for a sequential tunneling mechanism of charge transfer through neighbouring
amino acids. The model is validated by comparison with current-voltage
experiments. The predictability of the model is further tested on bovine
rhodopsin, a G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR) also sensitive to light. In this
case, results show an opposite behaviour with a decrease of conductance in the
presence of light.

analytically tractable, use two general approaches. The first approach,
generally known as compartmental modeling, addresses the time evolution of
disease propagation at the expense of simplifying the pattern of transmission.
The second approach uses network theory to incorporate detailed information
pertaining to the underlying contact structure among individuals while
disregarding the progression of time during outbreaks. So far, the only
alternative that enables the integration of both aspects of disease propagation
simultaneously while preserving the variety of outcomes has been to abandon the
analytical approach and rely on computer simulations. We offer a new analytical
framework, which incorporates both the complexity of contact network structure
and the time progression of disease spread. Furthermore, we demonstrate that
this framework is equally effective on finite- and "infinite"-size networks.
This formalism can be equally applied to similar percolation phenomena on
networks in other areas of science and technology.

detect variations in optical intensity, distribution, colour, and polarisation.
Polarisation vision systems studied to date detect one to four channels of
linear polarisation, combining them in opponent pairs to provide
intensity-independent operation. Circular polarisation vision has never been
seen, and is widely believed to play no part in animal vision. Polarisation is
fully measured via Stokes' parameters--obtained by combined linear and circular
polarisation measurements. Optimal polarisation vision is the ability to see
Stokes' parameters: here we show that the crustacean \emph{Gonodactylus
smithii} measures the exact components required. This vision provides optimal
contrast-enhancement, and precise determination of polarisation with no
confusion-states or neutral-points--significant advantages. We emphasise that
linear and circular polarisation vision are not different modalities--both are
necessary for optimal polarisation vision, regardless of the presence of
strongly linear or circularly polarised features in the animal's environment.

KroneNeuhauser (1997) as an analogue of the coalescent genealogy of a sample of
genes from a neutrally evolving population. The number of particles in this
graph, followed backwards in time, is a birth and death process with quadratic
death and linear birth rates. In this paper an explicit form of the probability
distribution of the number of particles is obtained by using the density of the
allele frequency in the corresponding diffusion model obtained by Kimura
(1955). It is shown that the process of fixation of the allele in the diffusion
model corresponds to convergence of the ancestral process to its stationary
measure. The time to fixation of the allele conditional on fixation is studied
in terms of the ancestral process.

occur in cells and the biosphere. These are open thermodynamic systems
exhibiting a flow of energy that is dissipated at a finite rate. Life does work
to acquire more energy, then uses the available energy it has gained to perform
more work. It is plausible that natural selection has optimized many biological
systems for power efficiency: useful power generated per unit fuel. In this
letter we begin to investigate these questions for random Boolean networks
using Landauer's erasure principle, which defines a minimum entropy cost for
bit erasure. We show that critical Boolean networks maximize available power
efficiency, which requires that the system have a finite displacement from
equilibrium. Our initial results may extend to more realistic models for cells
and ecosystems.

remains a fundamental question in the quest for the origin of life. Recent
works in this field introduce the concept of recycling, rather than the
traditional open-flow system described by Frank. This approach has been
criticized by Blackmond et al. They claimed that such systems are
thermodynamically impossible, except in the cases where non-microreversible
reactions are introduced, like in photochemical reactions, or under the
influence of physical actions (e.g. by crystal crushing). This point of view
reveals misunderstandings about this model of a recycled system, overlooks the
possibility of energy exchanges that could take place in prebiotic systems, and
leads the authors to unawarely remove the activation reaction and energy source
from their "non-equilibrium" models. It is especially important to understand
what are the concepts behind the notion of recycled systems, and of activation
reactions. These points are fundamental to comprehending how chemical systems
-- and especially prebiotic chemical systems -- can be maintained in
non-equilibrium steady states, and how free energy can be used and exchanged
between systems. The proposed approach aims at the decomposition of the
problem, avoiding to embrace the whole system at the same time.

the researchers interested in the origin of life. During the last decades,
stable non-racemic steady states of nonequilibrium chemical systems have been
discussed as a possible response to this problem. In line with this framework,
a description of recycled systems was provided in which stable products can be
activated back to reactive compounds. The dynamical behaviour of such systems
relies on the presence of a source of energy, leading to the continuous
maintaining of unidirectional reaction loops. A full thermodynamic study of
recycled systems, composed of microreversible reactions only, is presented
here, showing how the energy is transferred and distributed through the system,
leading to cycle competitions and the stabilization of asymmetric states.

information-theoretic view. We propose that the function-coding information
quantity of a genome always grows in the course of evolution through sequence
duplication, expansion of code, and gene transfer between genomes. The
function-coding information quantity of a genome consists of two parts,
p-coding information quantity which encodes functional protein and n-coding
information quantity which encodes other functional elements except amino acid
sequence. The relation of the proposed law to the thermodynamic laws is
indicated. The evolutionary trends of DNA sequences revealed by bioinformatics
are investigated which afford further evidences on the evolutionary law. It is
argued that the directionality of genome evolution comes from species
competition adaptive to environment. An expression on the evolutionary rate of
genome is proposed that the rate is a function of Darwin temperature
(describing species competition) and fitness slope (describing adaptive
landscape). Finally, the problem of directly experimental test on the
evolutionary directionality is discussed briefly.

exponentially decaying excitatory synaptic currents and double exponential
inhibitory synaptic currents has recently been introduced by Carnevale and
Hines. This integration scheme imposes non-physiological constraints on the
time constants of the synaptic currents it attempts to model which hamper the
general applicability. This paper addresses this problem in two ways. First, we
provide physical arguments to show why these constraints on the time constants
can be relaxed. Second, we give a formal proof showing which constraints can be
abolished. This proof rests on a generalization of the Carnevale-Hines lemma,
which is a new tool for comparing double exponentials as they naturally occur
in many cascaded decay systems including receptor-neurotransmitter dissociation
followed by channel closing. We show that this lemma can be generalized and
subsequently used for lifting most of the original constraints on the time
constants. Thus we show that the Carnevale-Hines integration scheme for the
integrate-and-fire model can be employed for simulating a much wider range of
neuron and synapse type combinations than is apparent from the original
treatment.

stable under changes in external conditions and internal reaction parameters.
Much recent work on robustness and evolvability has focused on the structure of
neutral spaces, in which system behavior remains invariant to mutations.
Recently we have shown that the collective behavior of multiparameter models is
most often 'sloppy': insensitive to changes except along a few 'stiff'
combinations of parameters, with an enormous sloppy neutral subspace.
Robustness is often assumed to be an emergent evolved property, but the
sloppiness natural to biochemical networks offers an alternative non-adaptive
explanation. Conversely, ideas developed to study evolvability in robust
systems can be usefully extended to characterize sloppy systems.

receptive field, or a set of linear filters, and a thresholding function, or
gain curve, which determines the firing probability; this is known as a
linear/nonlinear model. In some forms of sensory adaptation, these linear
filters and gain curve adjust very rapidly to changes in the variance of a
randomly varying driving input. An apparently similar but previously unrelated
issue is the observation of gain control by background noise in cortical
neurons: the slope of the firing rate vs current (f-I) curve changes with the
variance of background random input. Here, we show a direct correspondence
between these two observations by relating variance-dependent changes in the
gain of f-I curves to characteristics of the changing empirical
linear/nonlinear model obtained by sampling. In the case that the underlying
system is fixed, we derive relationships relating the change of the gain with
respect to both mean and variance with the receptive fields derived from
reverse correlation on a white noise stimulus. Using two conductance-based
model neurons that display distinct gain modulation properties through a simple
change in parameters, we show that coding properties of both these models
quantitatively satisfy the predicted relationships. Our results describe how
both variance-dependent gain modulation and adaptive neural computation result
from intrinsic nonlinearity.

different types of giant unilamellar vesicles, the first formed from EggPC
lipids and the second formed from DOPC lipids. Experiments on vesicles of both
lipid types show a decrease in vesicle radius which is interpreted as being due
to lipid loss during the permeabilization process. We show that the decrease in
size can be qualitatively explained as a loss of lipid area which is
proportional to the area of the vesicle which is permeabilized. Three possible
mechanisms responsible for lipid loss were directly observed: pore formation,
vesicle formation and tubule formation.

multidisciplinary study. This event is generally believed as a result of
genetic innovations, environmental factors and ecological interactions, even
though there are many conflicts on nature and timing of metazoan origins. The
crux of the matter is that an entire roadmap of the evolution is missing to
discern the biological complexity transition and to evaluate the critical role
of the Cambrian explosion in the overall evolutionary context. Here we
calculate the time of the Cambrian explosion by an innovative and accurate
"C-value clock"; our result (560 million years ago) quite fits the fossil
records. We clarify that the intrinsic reason of genome evolution determined
the Cambrian explosion. A general formula for evaluating genome size of
different species has been found, by which major questions of the C-value
enigma can be solved and the genome size evolution can be illustrated. The
Cambrian explosion is essentially a major transition of biological complexity,
which corresponds to a turning point in genome size evolution. The observed
maximum prokaryotic complexity is just a relic of the Cambrian explosion and it
is supervised by the maximum information storage capability in the observed
universe. Our results open a new prospect of studying metazoan origins and
molecular evolution.

modifier gene models, in which a neutral gene is posited to control the
transmission of other genes under selection. Analysis of modifier gene models
has found the manifestations of an "evolutionary reduction principle": in a
population near equilibrium, a new modifier allele that scales equally all
transition probabilities between different genotypes under selection can invade
if and only if it reduces the transition probabilities. Analytical results on
the reduction principle have always required some set of constraints for
tractability: limitations to one or two selected loci, two alleles per locus,
specific selection regimes or weak selection, specific genetic processes being
modified, extreme or infinitesimal effects of the modifier allele, or tight
linkage between modifier and selected loci. Here, I prove the reduction
principle in the absence of any of these constraints, confirming a twenty-year
old conjecture. The proof is obtained by a wider application of Karlin's
Theorem 5.2 (1982) and its extension to ML-matrices, substochastic matrices,
and reducible matrices.

Though
proteasomes are important for all aspects of the cellular metabolism, some
details of the physical mechanism of the process remain unknown. We introduce a
stochastic model of the proteasomal degradation of proteins, which accounts for
the protein translocation and the topology of the positioning of cleavage
centers of a proteasome from first principles. For this model we develop the
mathematical description based on a master-equation and techniques for
reconstruction of the cleavage specificity inherent to proteins and the
proteasomal translocation rates, which are a property of the proteasome specie,
from mass spectroscopy data on digestion patterns. With these properties
determined, one can quantitatively predict digestion patterns for new
experimental set-ups. Additionally we design an experimental set-up for a
synthetic polypeptide with a periodic sequence of amino acids, which enables
especially reliable determination of translocation rates.

results from various search methods is impeded by the lack of a universal
statistical standard. Providing an E-value calibration protocol, we
demonstrated earlier the feasibility of translating either the score or
heuristic E-value reported by any method into the textbook-defined E-value,
which may serve as the universal statistical standard. This protocol, although
robust, may lose spectrum-specific statistics and might require a new
calibration when changes in experimental setup occur. To mitigate these issues,
we developed a new MS/MS search tool, RAId_aPS, that is able to provide
spectrum-specific E-values for additive scoring functions. Given a selection of
scoring functions out of RAId score, K-score, Hyperscore and XCorr, RAId_aPS
generates the corresponding score histograms of all possible peptides using
dynamic programming. Using these score histograms to assign E-values enables a
calibration-free protocol for accurate significance assignment for each scoring
function. RAId_aPS features four different modes: (i) compute the total number
of possible peptides for a given molecular mass range, (ii) generate the score
histogram given a MS/MS spectrum and a scoring function, (iii) reassign
E-values for a list of candidate peptides given a MS/MS spectrum and the
scoring functions chosen, and (iv) perform database searches using selected
scoring functions. In modes (iii) and (iv), RAId_aPS is also capable of
combining results from different scoring functions using spectrum-specific
statistics. The web link is

mechanics of physical systems at a critical point. Here we examine the
distribution of pixels in small image patches and show how to construct the
corresponding thermodynamics. We find evidence for criticality in a diverging
specific heat, which corresponds to large fluctuations in how "surprising" we
find individual images, and in the quantitative form of the entropy vs. energy.
The energy landscape derived from our thermodynamic framework identifies
special image configurations that have intrinsic error correcting properties,
and neurons which could detect these features have a strong resemblance to the
cells found in primary visual cortex.

use statistical graph theory. Even in such a heavily simplified method, which
disregards most of the dynamic aspects of biochemistry, one is faced with
fundamental questions, such as how the chemical reaction systems should be
reduced to a graph retaining as much functional information as possible from
the original reaction system. In such graph representations, should the edges
go between substrates and products, or substrates and substrates, or both?
Should vertices represent substances or reactions? Different definitions encode
different information about the reaction system. In this paper we evaluate four
different graph representations of metabolism, applied to data from different
organisms and databases. The graph representations are evaluated by comparing
the overlap between clusters (network modules) and annotated functions, and
also by comparing the set of identified currency metabolites with those that
other authors have identified using qualitative biological arguments. We find
that a "substance network," where all metabolites participating in a reaction
are connected, is relatively better than others, evaluated both with respect to
the functional overlap between modules and functions and to the number and
identity of identified currency metabolites.

endemic equilibrium. We obtain conditions on the age-dependence of the
susceptibility to infection that imply the uniqueness of the endemic
equilibrium. An example with two endemic equilibria is shown. Finally, we
analyse numerically how the stability of the endemic equilibrium is affected by
extra-mortality and by the possible periodicities induced by the demographic
age-structure.

and tau proteins, we extend lattice-based models of intracellular transport to
include a second species of particle which locally influences the
motor-filament attachment rate. We consider various exactly solvable limits of
a stochastic multi-particle model before focusing on the low-motor-density
regime. Here, an approximate treatment based on the random walk behaviour of
single motors gives good quantitative agreement with simulation results for the
tau-dependence of the motor current. Finally, we discuss the possible
physiological implications of our results.

critically evaluated. We test mean packing, mean pairwise energy and the new
index gVSL2 on a dataset of 743 folded proteins and 81 natively unfolded
proteins. These predictors have an individual performance comparable or even
better than other proposed methods. We introduce here a strictly unanimous
score S_{SU} that combines them but leaves undecided those sequences
differently classified by two single predictors. The performance of the single
predictors on a dataset purged from the proteins left unclassified by S_{SU},
significantly increases, indicating that unclassified proteins are mainly false
predictions. Amino acid composition is the main determinant considered by these
predictors, therefore unclassified proteins have a composition compatible with
both folded and unfolded status. This is why purging a dataset from these
ambiguous proteins increases the performance of single predictors. The
percentage of proteins predicted as natively unfolded by S_{SU} in the three
kingdoms are: 4.1% for Bacteria, 1.0% for Archaea and 20.0% for Eukarya;
compatible with previous determinations. Evidence is given of a scaling law
relating the number of natively unfolded proteins with the total number of
proteins in a genome; a first estimate of the critical exponent is 1.95 +- 0.21

computed as a function of the penalties for mismatches and spaces, producing
many different optimal alignments. Here we give a 3/(2^{7/3}\pi^{2/3})n^{2/3}
+O(n^{1/3} \log n) lower bound on the maximum number of distinct optimal
alignment summaries of length-n binary sequences. This shows that the upper
bound given by Gusfield et. al. is tight over all alphabets, thereby disproving
the "square root of n conjecture". Thus the maximum number of distinct optimal
alignment summaries (i.e. vertices of the alignment polytope) over all pairs of
length-n sequences is Theta(n^{2/3}).

suddenly. It is known that the fluctuation enhancement (FE) occurs after the
perturbation, where FE means a population uncertainty. In the present paper, we
develop a new theory of stochastic differential equation. The agreement between
the theory and the mean-field simulation is almost perfect. This theory enables
us to find much stronger FE than reported previously. We discuss the population
uncertainty in the recovering process of endangered species.

DNA play pivotal roles in many biological milieus, such as in the site-specific
binding of transcription factors to target regulatory elements. To better
understand DNA structure, function, and dynamics in general, and protein-DNA
recognition in the 'kB' family of genetic regulatory elements in particular, we
performed molecular dynamics simulations of a 20-base pair DNA encompassing a
cognate kB site recognized by the proto-oncogenic 'c-Rel' subfamily of NF-kB
transcription factors. Simulations of the kB DNA in explicit water were
extended to microsecond duration, providing a broad, atomically-detailed
glimpse into the structural and dynamical behavior of double helical DNA over
many timescales. Of particular note, novel (and structurally plausible)
conformations of DNA developed only at the long times sampled in this
simulation -- including a peculiar state arising at ~ 0.7 us and characterized
by cross-strand intercalative stacking of nucleotides within a
longitudinally-sheared base pair, followed (at ~ 1 us) by spontaneous base
flipping of a neighboring thymine within the A-rich duplex. Results and
predictions from the us-scale simulation include implications for a dynamical
NF-kB recognition motif, and are amenable to testing and further exploration
via specific experimental approaches that are suggested herein.

interspike-interval density of a continuously stimulated spiking neuron. The
model allows the conditional interspike-interval density and the stationary
interspike-interval density to be expressed as products of two separate
functions, one of which describes only the neuron characteristics, and the
other of which describes only the signal characteristics. This allows the use
of this model to predict the response when the underlying neuron model is not
known or well determined. The approximation shows particularly clearly that
signal autocorrelations and cross-correlations arise as natural features of the
interspike-interval density, and are particularly clear for small signals and
moderate noise. We show that this model simplifies the design of spiking neuron
cross-correlation systems, and describe a four-neuron mutual inhibition network
that generates a cross-correlation output for two input signals.

values on the space of rooted binary trees, similar to the Aldous-Shields
model. Fix $n\ge 1$ and $\beta&gt;0$. We start at time 0 with the tree composed of
a root only. At any time, each node with no descendants, independently from the
other nodes, produces two successors at rate $\beta(n-k)/n$, where $k$ is the
distance from the node to the root. Denote by $Z_n(t)$ the number of nodes with
no descendants at time $t$ and let $T_n = \beta^{-1} n \ln(n /\ln 4) + (\ln
2)/(2 \beta)$. We prove that $2^{-n} Z_n(T_n + n \tau)$, $\tau\in\bb R$,
converges to the Gompertz curve $\exp (- (\ln 2) e^{-\beta \tau})$. We also
prove a central limit theorem for the martingale associated to $Z_n(t)$.

changes that force to adapt new conformation of the interaction pattern between
the components of that system. Measuring the structural differences one can
retrace the evolutionary relation between two systems. We present a method to
quantify the topological distance between two networks of different sizes,
finding that the architectures of the networks are more similar within the same
class than the outside of their class. With 43 cellular networks of different
species, we show that the evolutionary relationship can be elucidated from the
structural distances.

  comparing humans and fish species</title><categories>q-bio.PE q-bio.QM</categories><comments>Masters thesis</comments><license>http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/</license><abstract>  The analysis of eight molecular datasets involving human and teleost examples
along with morphological samples from several groups of Neotropical electric
fish (Order: Gymnotiformes) were used in this thesis to test the dynamics of
both intraspecific variation and interspecific diversity. In terms of
investigating molecular interspecific diversity among humans, two experimental
exercises were performed. A cladistic exchange experiment tested for the extent
of discontinuity and interbreeding between H. sapiens and neanderthal
populations. As part of the same question, another experimental exercise tested
the amount of molecular variance resulting from simulations which treated
neanderthals as being either a local population of modern humans or as a
distinct subspecies. Finally, comparisons of hominid populations over time with
fish species helped to define what constitutes taxonomically relevant
differences between morphological populations as expressed among both trait
size ranges and through growth patterns that begin during ontogeny. Compared to
the subdivision found within selected teleost species, H. sapiens molecular
data exhibited little variation and discontinuity between geographical regions.
Results of the two experimental exercises concluded that neanderthals exhibit
taxonomic distance from modern H. sapiens. However, this distance was not so
great as to exclude the possibility of interbreeding between the two
subspecific groups. Finally, a series of characters were analyzed among species
of Neotropical electric fish. These analyses were compared with hominid
examples to determine what constituted taxonomically relevant differences
between populations as expressed among specific morphometric traits that
develop during the juvenile phase.

selection in a population of tumor cells. We discuss mathematical models of
cancer progression, starting from traditional multistage theory. Each stage is
associated with the occurrence of genetic alterations and their fixation in the
population. We describe the accumulation of mutations using conjunctive
Bayesian networks, an exponential family of waiting time models in which the
occurrence of mutations is constrained to a partial temporal order. Two
opposing limit cases arise if mutations either follow a linear order or occur
independently. We derive exact analytical expressions for the waiting time
until a specific number of mutations have accumulated in these limit cases as
well as for the general conjunctive Bayesian network. Finally, we analyze a
stochastic population genetics model that explicitly accounts for mutation and
selection. In this model, waves of clonal expansions sweep through the
population at equidistant intervals. We present an approximate analytical
expression for the waiting time in this model and compare it to the results
obtained for the conjunctive Bayesian networks.

periodic lattices. Pinwheel crystallization depends on the overall dominance of
one eye over the other, a condition that is fulfilled during early cortical
development. Increasing the strength of inter-map coupling induces a transition
from pinwheel-free stripe solutions to intermediate and high pinwheel density
states.

the earliest gene systems found to undergo both positive and negative control.
The lac operon is known to exhibit bistability, in the sense that the operon is
either induced or uninduced. Many dynamical models have been proposed to
capture this phenomenon. While most are based on complex mathematical
formulations, it has been suggested that for other gene systems network
topology is sufficient to produce the desired dynamical behavior.
  We present a Boolean network as a discrete model for the lac operon. We
include the two main glucose control mechanisms of catabolite repression and
inducer exclusion in the model and show that it exhibits bistability. Further
we present a reduced model which shows that lac mRNA and lactose form the core
of the lac operon, and that this reduced model also exhibits the same dynamics.
This work corroborates the claim that the key to dynamical properties is the
topology of the network and signs of interactions.

planet is a key challenge of science. The Tree of Life represents such
diversification processes through the evolutionary relationships among the
different taxa, and can be extended down to intra-specific relationships. Here
we examine the topological properties of a large set of interspecific and
intraspecific phylogenies and show that the branching patterns follow
allometric rules conserved across the different levels in the Tree of Life, all
significantly departing from those expected from the standard null models. The
finding of non-random universal patterns of phylogenetic differentiation
suggests that similar evolutionary forces drive diversification across the
broad range of scales, from macro-evolutionary to micro-evolutionary processes,
shaping the diversity of life on the planet.

a periodic modulation of its environment. We investigate this effect using, as
an example, a stochastic branching-annihilation process with a time-dependent
branching rate. The population extinction is treated in eikonal approximation,
where it is described as an instanton trajectory of a proper reaction
Hamiltonian. The modulation of the environment perturbs this trajectory and
synchronizes it with the modulation phase. We calculate the corresponding
change in the action along the instanton using perturbation techniques
supported by numerical calculations. The techniques include a first-order
theory with respect to the modulation amplitude, a second-order theory in the
spirit of the Kapitsa pendulum effect, and adiabatic theory valid for low
modulation frequencies.

phylogenetic relationships among species and higher taxa: phylogenetic trees,
Hennig trees and Nelson cladograms. All three models are trees, as that term is
commonly used in mathematics; the difference between them lies in the
biological interpretation of their vertices and edges. Phylogenetic trees and
Hennig trees carry exactly the same information, and translation between these
two kinds of trees can be accomplished by a simple algorithm. On the other
hand, evolutionary concepts such as monophyly are represented as different
mathematical substructures are represented differently in the two models. For
each phylogenetic or Hennig tree, there is a Nelson cladogram carrying the same
information, but the requirement that all taxa be represented by leaves
necessarily makes the representation less efficient. Moreover, we claim that it
is necessary to give some interpretation to the edges and internal vertices of
a Nelson cladogram in order to make it useful as a biological model. One
possibility is to interpret internal vertices as sets of characters and the
edges as statements of inclusion; however, this interpretation carries little
more than incomplete phenetic information. We assert that from the standpoint
of phylogenetics, one is forced to regard each internal vertex of a Nelson
cladogram as an actual (albeit unsampled) species simply to justify the use of
synapomorphies rather than symplesiomorphies.

in yeast populations under certain conditions and several unsatisfactory
explanations for this phenomenon have been proposed. These "autonomous
oscillations" have often appeared with periods that are nearly integer divisors
of the calculated doubling time of the culture.
  We hypothesize that these oscillations could be caused by a weak form of cell
cycle synchronization that we call clustering. We develop some novel ordinary
differential equation models of the cell cycle. For these models, and for
random and stochastic perturbations, we give both rigorous proofs and
simulations showing that both positive and negative growth rate feedback within
the cell cycle are possible agents that can cause clustering of populations
within the cell cycle. It occurs for a variety of models and for a broad
selection of parameter values. These results suggest that the clustering
phenomenon is robust and is likely to be observed in nature. Since there are
necessarily an integer number of clusters, clustering would lead to
periodic-like behavior with periods that are nearly integer divisors of the
period of the cell cycle.

the genetic code and raises questions which are very different from those posed
by very long sequences, which have been extensively studied. We investigate
this problem by combining experiments and theory. A new experimental method
allows us to make a mapping of the opening of the guanines along the sequence
as a function of temperature. The results indicate that non-local effects may
be important in DNA because an AT-rich region is able to influence the opening
of a base pair which is about 10 base pairs away. An earlier mesoscopic model
of DNA is modified to correctly describe the time scales associated to the
opening of individual base pairs well below melting, and to properly take into
account the sequence. Using this model to analyze some characteristic sequences
for which detailed experimental data on the melting is available [Montrichok et
al. 2003 Europhys. Lett. {\bf 62} 452], we show that we have to introduce
non-local effects of AT-rich regions to get acceptable results. This brings a
second indication that the influence of these highly fluctuating regions of DNA
on their neighborhood can extend to some distance.

infall toward the Virgo Cluster may be a source of periodicity in cosmic ray
exposure as the solar system oscillates perpendicular to the galactic plane.
Here we investigate a mechanism by which cosmic rays might affect terrestrial
biodiversity, ionization and dissociation in the atmosphere, resulting in
depletion of ozone and a resulting increase in the dangerous solar UVB flux on
the ground, with an improved ionization background computation averaged over a
massive ensemble (about 7 x 10^5) shower simulations. We study minimal and full
exposure to the postulated extragalactic background. The atmospheric effects
are greater than with our earlier, simplified ionization model. At the lower
end of the range effects are too small to be of serious consequence. At the
upper end of the range, ~6 % global average loss of ozone column density
exceeds that currently experienced due to effects such as accumulated
chlorofluorocarbons. The intensity is less than a nearby supernova or galactic
gamma-ray burst, but the duration would be about 10^6 times longer. Present UVB
enhancement from current ozone depletion ~3% is a documented stress on the
biosphere, but a depletion of the magnitude found at the upper end of our range
would double the global average UVB flux. For estimates at the upper end of the
range of the cosmic ray variability over geologic time, the mechanism of
atmospheric ozone depletion may provide a major biological stress, which could
easily bring about major loss of biodiversity. Future high energy astrophysical
observations will resolve the question of whether such depletion is likely.

modeling. At the first (microscopic) scale, neurons are considered individually
and their behavior described by stochastic differential equations that govern
the time variations of their membrane potentials. They are coupled by synaptic
connections acting on their resulting activity, a nonlinear function of their
membrane potential. At the second (mesoscopic) scale, interacting populations
of neurons are described individually by similar equations. The equations
describing the dynamical and the stationary mean field behaviors are considered
as functional equations on a set of stochastic processes. Using this new point
of view allows us to prove that these equations are well-posed on any finite
time interval and to provide a constructive method for effectively computing
their unique solution. This method is proved to converge to the unique solution
and we characterize its complexity and convergence rate. We also provide
partial results for the stationary problem on infinite time intervals. These
results shed some new light on such neural mass models as the one of Jansen and
Rit \cite{jansen-rit:95}: their dynamics appears as a coarse approximation of
the much richer dynamics that emerges from our analysis. Our numerical
experiments confirm that the framework we propose and the numerical methods we
derive from it provide a new and powerful tool for the exploration of neural
behaviors at different scales.

hot spring environments have revealed surprisingly complex ecosystems, with an
unexpected level of genetic diversity. One case of particular interest involves
the distribution along hot spring thermal gradients of genetically distinct
bacterial strains that differ in their preferred temperatures for reproduction
and photosynthesis. In such systems, a single variable, temperature, defines
the relevant environmental variation. In spite of this, each region along the
thermal gradient exhibits multiple strains of photosynthetic bacteria adapted
to several distinct thermal optima, rather than the expected single thermal
strain adapted to the local environmental temperature. Here we analyze
microbiology data from several ecological studies to show that the thermal
distribution field data exhibit several universal features independent of
location and specific bacterial strain. These include the distribution of
optimal temperatures of different thermal strains and the functional dependence
of the net population density on temperature. Further, we present a simple
population dynamics model of these systems that is highly constrained by
biophysical data and by physical features of the environment. This model can
explain in detail the observed diversity of different strains of the
photosynthetic bacteria. It also reproduces the observed thermal population
distributions, as well as certain features of population dynamics observed in
laboratory studies of the same organisms.

organization and segregation of bacterial chromosomes. The author uses a
"piston" analogy for bacterial chromosomes in a cell, which leads to a phase
diagram for the organization of two athermal chains confined in a closed
geometry characterized by two length scales (length and width). When applied to
rod-shaped bacteria such as Escherichia coli, this phase diagram predicts that,
despite strong confinement, duplicated chromosomes will demix, i.e., there
exists a primordial physical driving force for chromosome segregation. The
author discusses segregation of duplicating chromosomes using the
concentric-shell model, which predicts that newly synthesized DNA will be found
in the periphery of the chromosome during replication. In contrast to
chromosomes, these results suggest that most plasmids will be randomly
distributed inside the cell because of their small sizes. An active
partitioning system is therefore required for accurate segregation of low-copy
number plasmids. Implications of these results are also sketched, e.g., on the
role of proteins, segregation mechanisms for bacteria of diverse shapes, cell
cycle of an artificial cell, and evolution.

models which, without noise, would predict a stable finite population. We study
this effect on the example of a stochastic birth-death model which includes
immigration, binary reproduction and death. The unlimited population growth
proceeds as an exponentially slow decay of a metastable probability
distribution (MPD) of the population. We develop a systematic WKB theory,
complemented by the van Kampen system size expansion, for the MPD and for the
decay time. Important signatures of the MPD is a power-law tail (such that all
the distribution moments, except the zeroth one, diverge) and the presence in
the solution of two different WKB modes.

inhibition must be achieved. However, when such a balance is sought by global
strategies, only few modes remain balanced close to instability, and all other
modes are strongly stable. Here we present a simple model of neural tissue in
which this balance is sought locally by neurons following `anti-Hebbian'
behavior: {\sl all} degrees of freedom achieve a close balance of excitation
and inhibition and become "critical" in the dynamical sense. At long
timescales, the modes of our model oscillate around the instability line, so an
extremely complex "breakout" dynamics ensues in which different modes of the
system oscillate between prominence and extinction. We show the system develops
various anomalous statistical behaviours and hence becomes self-organized
critical in the statistical sense.

  the Human Brain</title><categories>quant-ph q-bio.NC</categories><comments>22 pages, 2 figures, to appear in Foundations of Physics</comments><license>http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/</license><abstract>  The feasibility of wave function collapse in the human brain has been the
subject of vigorous scientific debates since the advent of quantum theory.
Scientists like Von Neumann, London, Bauer and Wigner (initially) believed that
wave function collapse occurs in the brain or is caused by the mind of the
observer. It is a legitimate question to ask how human brain can receive subtle
external visual quantum information intact when it must pass through very noisy
and complex pathways from the eye to the brain? There are several approaches to
investigate information processing in the brain, each of which presents a
different set of conclusions. Penrose and Hameroff have hypothesized that there
is quantum information processing inside the human brain whose material
substrate involves microtubules and consciousness is the result of a collective
wavefunction collapse occurring in these structures. Conversely, Tegmark stated
that owing to thermal decoherence there cannot be any quantum processing in
neurons of the brain and processing in the brain must be classical for
cognitive processes. However, Rosa and Faber presented an argument for a middle
way which shows that none of the previous authors are completely right and
despite the presence of decoherence, it is still possible to consider the brain
to be a quantum system. Additionally, Thaheld, has concluded that quantum
states of photons do collapse in the human eye and there is no possibility for
collapse of visual quantum states in the brain and thus there is no possibility
for the quantum state reduction in the brain. In this paper we conclude that if
we accept the main essence of the above approaches taken together, each of them
can provide a different part of a teleportation mechanism.

been proposed as flexible and cost-effective instruments for biodiversity
conservation on private lands. Trading the service of conservation requires one
to define a metric that determines the extent to which a conserved site adds to
the regional conservation objective. Yet, while markets for conservation are
widely discussed and increasingly applied, little research has been conducted
on explicitly accounting for spatial ecological processes in the trading. In
this paper, we use a coupled ecological economic simulation model to examine
how spatial connectivity may be considered in the financial incentives created
by a market-based conservation scheme. Land use decisions, driven by changing
conservation costs and the conservation market, are simulated by an agent-based
model of land users. On top of that, a metapopulation model evaluates the
conservational success of the market. We find that optimal spatial incentives
for agents correlate with species characteristics such as the dispersal
distance, but they also depend on the spatio-temporal distribution of
conservation costs. We conclude that a combined analysis of ecological and
socio-economic conditions should be applied when designing market instruments
to protect biodiversity.

around the time of the origin of life the handedness of biomolecules must have
established itself through an instability. Possible pathways of producing a
certain handedness include mechanisms involving either autocatalysis or,
alternatively, epimerization as governing effects. Concepts for establishing
hereditary information are discussed in terms of the theory of hypercycles.
Instabilities toward parasites and possible remedies by invoking spatial extent
are reviewed. Finally, some effects of early life are discussed that
contributed to modifying and regulating atmosphere and climate of the Earth,
and that could have contributed to the highly oxidized state of its crust.

species. It is a ubiquitous evolutionary phenomenon particularly common among
prey species, in which case the advantage involves better protection from
predation. We formulate a mathematical description of mimicry among prey
species, to investigate benefits and disadvantages of mimicry. The basic setup
involves differential equations for quantities representing predator behavior,
namely, the probabilities for attacking prey at the next encounter. Using this
framework, we present new quantitative results, and also provide a unified
description of a significant fraction of the quantitative mimicry literature.
The new results include `temporary' mutualism between prey species, and an
optimal density at which the survival benefit is greatest for the mimic. The
formalism leads naturally to extensions in several directions, such as the
evolution of mimicry, the interplay of mimicry with population dynamics, etc.
We demonstrate this extensibility by presenting some explorations on
spatiotemporal pattern dynamics.

systems at different scales, and how this organization changes in time.
Describing structures at different scales as goal-oriented agents, one can
define $\sigma \in [0,1]$ ("satisfaction") as the degree to which the goals of
each agent at each scale have been met. $\sigma$ reflects the organization
degree at that scale. The $\sigma$ profile of a system shows the satisfaction
at different scales, with the possibility to study their dependencies and
evolution. It can also be used to extend game theoretic models. A general
tendency on the evolution of complexity and cooperation naturally follows from
the $\sigma$ profile. Experiments on a virtual ecosystem are used as
illustration.

The
conventional models of biological periodic oscillations are usually proposed as
interconnecting transcriptional feedback loops. Some specific proteins function
as transcription factors, which in turn negatively regulate the expression of
the genes that encode those "clock protein". These loops may lead to rhythmic
changes in gene expression of a cell. In the case of multi-cellular tissue, the
collective oscillation is often obtained from synchronization of these cells,
which manifest themselves as autonomous oscillators. In contrast, here, we
propose a different scenario for the occurrence of collective oscillation in a
multi-cellular system independent of oscillation, neither intrinsically
oscillatory cells nor periodic external stimulation. It is a coupling induced
oscillation, with the consideration of wave propagation due to the
intracellular communication.

the influence of the competition between several activity-dependent synaptic
processes, such as short-term synaptic facilitation and depression, on the
maximum memory storage capacity in a neural network. In contrast with the case
of synaptic depression, which drastically reduces the capacity of the network
to store and retrieve "static" activity patterns, synaptic facilitation
enhances the storage capacity in different contexts. In particular, we found
optimal values of the relevant synaptic parameters (such as the
neurotransmitter release probability or the characteristic facilitation time
constant) for which the storage capacity can be maximal and similar to the one
obtained with static synapses, that is, without activity-dependent processes.
We conclude that depressing synapses with a certain level of facilitation allow
to recover the good retrieval properties of networks with static synapses while
maintaining the nonlinear characteristics of dynamic synapses, convenient for
information processing and coding.

filaments or microtubules taking into account insertion, removal, and ATP/GTP
hydrolysis of subunits. The resulting phase diagram contains three different
phases: a rapidly growing phase, an intermediate phase and a bound phase. We
analyze all these phases, with an emphasis on the bound phase. We also discuss
how hydrolysis affects force-velocity curves. The bound phase shows features of
dynamic instability, which we characterize in terms of the time needed for the
ATP/GTP cap to disappear as well as the time needed for the filament to reach a
length of zero, i.e., (to collapse) for the first time. We obtain exact
expressions for all these quantities, which we test using Monte Carlo
simulations.

to Markov invariants, thereby extending previous theoretical results by
systematically identifying linear combinations that vanish for a given quartet.
We also note that the theory is fully generalizable to arbitrary trees and is
equally applicable to the related case of phylogenetic invariants. All results
follow from elementary consideration of the representation theory of finite

hallmark of intelligent behavior, very little is known about the neuronal
mechanisms that support this processing. In a step toward solving this problem
we demonstrate by theoretical analysis and simulation how networks of richly
inter-connected neurons, such as those observed in the superficial layers of
the neocortex, can embed reliable robust finite state machines. We show how a
multi-stable neuronal network containing a number of states can be created very
simply, by coupling two recurrent networks whose synaptic weights have been
configured for soft winner-take-all (sWTA) performance. These two sWTAs have
simple, homogenous locally recurrent connectivity except for a small fraction
of recurrent cross-connections between them, which are used to embed the
required states. This coupling between the maps allows the network to continue
to express the current state even after the input that elicted that state is
withdrawn. In addition, a small number of 'transition neurons' implement the
necessary input-driven transitions between the embedded states. We provide
simple rules to systematically design and construct neuronal state machines of
this kind. The significance of our finding is that it offers a method whereby
the cortex could construct networks supporting a broad range of sophisticated
processing by applying only small specializations to the same generic neuronal
circuit.

effect of regulating the trans-synaptic weights of loops of any length within a
simulated network of neurons. We show that depending on STDP's polarity,
functional loops are formed or eliminated in networks driven to normal spiking
conditions by random, partially correlated inputs, where functional loops
comprise weights that exceed a non-zero threshold. We further prove that STDP
is a form of loop-regulating plasticity for the case of a linear network
comprising random weights drawn from certain distributions. Thus a notable
local synaptic learning rule makes a specific prediction about synapses in the
brain in which standard STDP is present: that under normal spiking conditions,
they should participate in predominantly feed-forward connections at all
scales. Our model implies that any deviations from this prediction would
require a substantial modification to the hypothesized role for standard STDP.
Given its widespread occurrence in the brain, we predict that STDP could also
regulate long range synaptic loops among individual neurons across all brain
scales, up to, and including, the scale of global brain network topology.

on cultural memes that colonize humans hosts. In analogy to studying the
evolution of pathogens or symbionts colonizing animal hosts, we use models for
host-pathogen dynamics known from theoretical epidemiology. In these models,
religious memes colonize individual humans. Rates of transmission of memes
between humans, i.e., transmission of cultural content, and rates of loss of
memes (loss of faith) are determined by the phenotype of the cultural memes,
and by interactions between hosts carrying different memes. In particular,
based on the notion that religion can lead to oppression of lower classes once
a religious society has reached a certain size, we assume that the rate of loss
increases as the number of humans colonized by a particular meme phenotype
increases. This generates frequency-dependent selection on cultural memes, and
we use evolutionary theory to show that this frequency dependence can generate
the emergence of coexisting clusters of different meme types. The different
clusters correspond to different religions, and hence our model describes the
emergence of distinct descendent religions from single ancestral religions.

Biosci. Eng. 6(3):521-545, 2009</journal-ref><license>http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/</license><abstract>  In this paper we consider chemotherapy in a spatial model of tumor growth.
The model, which is of reaction-diffusion type, takes into account the complex
interactions between the tumor and surrounding stromal cells by including
densities of endothelial cells and the extra-cellular matrix. When no treatment
is applied the model reproduces the typical dynamics of early tumor growth. The
initially avascular tumor reaches a diffusion limited size of the order of
millimeters and initiates angiogenesis through the release of vascular
endothelial growth factor (VEGF) secreted by hypoxic cells in the core of the
tumor. This stimulates endothelial cells to migrate towards the tumor and
establishes a nutrient supply sufficient for sustained invasion. To this model
we apply cytostatic treatment in the form of a VEGF-inhibitor, which reduces
the proliferation and chemotaxis of endothelial cells. This treatment has the
capability to reduce tumor mass, but more importantly, we were able to
determine that inhibition of endothelial cell proliferation is the more
important of the two cellular functions targeted by the drug. Further, we
considered the application of a cytotoxic drug that targets proliferating tumor
cells. The drug was treated as a diffusible substance entering the tissue from
the blood vessels. Our results show that depending on the characteristics of
the drug it can either reduce the tumor mass significantly or in fact
accelerate the growth rate of the tumor. This result seems to be due to
complicated interplay between the stromal and tumor cell types and highlights
the importance of considering chemotherapy in a spatial context.

in an environment dominated by Brownian motion. The aim of this paper is to
explore the flow of energy between the molecular motors and its surroundings,
in particular, its efficiency. Based on the Fokker-Planck equation with either
$N$ or infinite chemical states, we find that the energy efficiency of the
molecular motors, whether the Stokes efficiency or the usual thermodynamic
efficiency, is strictly bounded by 1, because of the dissipation of the energy
in both the overdamped surroundings and in the process of the chemical
reaction.

individuals of Nezara viridula (L.), by analyzing the temporal and spectral
features of the non-pulsed type female calling song emitted by single
individuals. We have measured the threshold level for the signal detection, by
performing experiments with the calling signal at different intensities and
analyzing the insect response by directionality tests performed on a group of
male individuals. By using a sub-threshold signal and an acoustic Gaussian
noise source, we have investigated the insect response for different levels of
noise, finding behavioral activation for suitable noise intensities. In
particular, the percentage of insects which react to the sub-threshold signal,
shows a non-monotonic behavior, characterized by the presence of a maximum, for
increasing levels of the noise intensity. This constructive interplay between
external noise and calling signal is the signature of the non-dynamical
stochastic resonance phenomenon. Finally, we describe the behavioral activation
statistics by a soft threshold model which shows stochastic resonance. We find
that the maximum of the ensemble average of the input-output cross-correlation
occurs at a value of the noise intensity very close to that for which the
behavioral response has a maximum.

is explored in bursting nerve cells. A modeling study is performed to show that
a large class of bursting systems, as defined by a shared topology when
represented as dynamical systems, is inherently suited to support
multistability. We derive the bifurcation structure and parametric trends
leading to multistability in these systems. Evidence for the existence of
multirhythmic behavior in neurons of the aquatic mollusc Aplysia californica
that is consistent with our proposed mechanism is presented. Although these
experimental results are preliminary, they indicate that single neurons may be
capable of dynamically storing information for longer time scales than
typically attributed to nonsynaptic mechanisms.

the plasma membranes of mammalian cells by an unknown mechanism called
transduction as well as by endocytosis and macropinocytosis. These
cell-penetrating peptides (CPPs) promise to be medically useful when fused to
biologically active peptides. I offer a simple model in which one or more CPPs
and the phosphatidylserines of the inner leaflet form a kind of capacitor with
a voltage in excess of 180 mV, high enough to create a molecular electropore.
The model is consistent with an empirical upper limit on the cargo peptide of
40--60 amino acids and with experimental data on how the transduction of a
polyarginine-fluorophore into mouse C2C12 myoblasts depends on the number of
arginines in the CPP and on the CPP concentration. The model makes three
testable predictions.

it has just emitted a spike. We propose a neuron model that after spike
emission exhibits a partial response to residual input charges and study its
collective network dynamics analytically. We uncover a novel desynchronization
mechanism that causes a sequential desynchronization transition: In globally
coupled neurons an increase in the strength of the partial response induces a
sequence of bifurcations from states with large clusters of synchronously
firing neurons, through states with smaller clusters to completely asynchronous
spiking. We briefly discuss key consequences of this mechanism for more general
networks of biophysical neurons.

dividing host cells within an organism or cell culture, and find a range of
viral replication rates that allows viruses to persist, avoiding extinction of
host cells or dilution of viruses at too rapid or too slow viral replication.
For the within-host competition between multiple viral strains, a strain with a
"stable" replication rate could outcompete another strain with a higher or
lower replication rate, therefore natural selection of viruses stabilizes the
viral persistence. However, when strains with higher and lower than the
"stable" value replication rates are both present, competition between strains
does not result in dominance of one strain, but in their coexistence.

input correlations to correlations of spikes. We find that the low common input
regime is governed by firing rate dependent spike correlations which are
sensitive to the detailed structure of input correlation functions. In the high
common input regime the spike correlations are insensitive to the firing rate
and exhibit a universal peak shape independent of input correlations. Rate
heterogeneous pairs driven by common inputs in general exhibit asymmetric spike
correlations. All predictions are confirmed in in vitro experiments with
cortical neurons driven by synthesized fluctuating input currents.

contexts-- produce trees whose depth scales logarithmically with the number of
leaves. Phylogenetic trees, describing the evolutionary relationships between
biological species, are examples of trees for which such scaling is not
observed. With this motivation, we analyze numerically two branching models
leading to non-logarithmic scaling of the depth with the number of leaves. For
Ford's alpha model, although a power-law scaling of the depth with tree size
was established analytically, our numerical results illustrate that the
asymptotic regime is approached only at very large tree sizes. We introduce
here a new model, the activity model, showing analytically and numerically that
it also displays a power-law scaling of the depth with tree size at a critical
parameter value.

asymptotically stable, under mild hypothesis, by using appropriate Lyapunov
functions. We also characterise the stable equilibrium points for the entire
biologically relevant parameter range. As a byproduct, we are able to determine
what is the diversity of the persistent strains.

weak-selection, and for different scalings. Depending on the particular choice
of scalings, we obtain a continuous model that may highlight the genetic-drift
(neutral evolution) or natural selection; for one precise scaling, both effects
are present. For the scalings that take the genetic-drift into account, the
continuous model is given by a singular diffusion equation, together with two
conservation laws that are already present at the discrete level. For scalings
that take into account only natural selection, we obtain a hyperbolic singular
equation that embeds the Replicator Dynamics and satisfies only one
conservation law. The derivation is made in two steps: a formal one, where the
candidate limit model is obtained, and a rigorous one, where convergence of the
probability density is proved. Additional results on the fixation probabilities
are also presented.

multivalent counterions, specifically Mg$^{+2}$ counterions, is studied.
Experimentally, it is known that MgSO$_4$ salt has a strong and non-monotonic
effect on the amount of DNA ejected. There exists an optimal concentration at
which the minimum amount of DNA is ejected from the virus. At lower or higher
concentrations, more DNA is ejected from the capsid. We propose that this
phenomenon is the result of DNA overcharging by Mg$^{+2}$ multivalent
counterions. As Mg$^{+2}$ concentration increases from zero, the net charge of
DNA changes from negative to positive. The optimal inhibition corresponds to
the Mg$^{+2}$ concentration where DNA is neutral. At lower/higher
concentrations, DNA genome is charged. It prefers to be in solution to lower
its electrostatic self-energy, which consequently leads to an increase in DNA
ejection. By fitting our theory to available experimental data, the strength of
DNA$-$DNA short range attraction energies, mediated by Mg$^{+2}$, is found to
be $-$0.004 $k_BT$ per nucleotide base. This and other fitted parameters agree
well with known values from other experiments and computer simulations. The
parameters are also in aggreement qualitatively with values for tri- and
tetra-valent counterions.

  accepted to PRE</comments><doi>10.1103/PhysRevE.79.061908</doi><license>http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/</license><abstract>  Complex systems are often modeled as Boolean networks in attempts to capture
their logical structure and reveal its dynamical consequences. Approximating
the dynamics of continuous variables by discrete values and Boolean logic gates
may, however, introduce dynamical possibilities that are not accessible to the
original system. We show that large random networks of variables coupled
through continuous transfer functions often fail to exhibit the complex
dynamics of corresponding Boolean models in the disordered (chaotic) regime,
even when each individual function appears to be a good candidate for Boolean
idealization. A suitably modified Boolean theory explains the behavior of
systems in which information does not propagate faithfully down certain chains
of nodes. Model networks incorporating calculated or directly measured transfer
functions reported in the literature on transcriptional regulation of genes are
described by the modified theory.

us to investigate how various factors such as barriers to cultural diffusion,
the presence and choice of leaders, or changes in the ratio of innovation to
imitation affect the diversity and effectiveness of ideas. It consists of
neural network based agents that invent ideas for actions, and imitate
neighbors' actions. The model is based on a theory of culture according to
which what evolves through culture is not memes or artifacts, but the internal
models of the world that give rise to them, and they evolve not through a
Darwinian process of competitive exclusion but a Lamarckian process involving
exchange of innovation protocols. EVOC shows an increase in mean fitness of
actions over time, and an increase and then decrease in the diversity of
actions. Diversity of actions is positively correlated with population size and
density, and with barriers between populations. Slowly eroding borders increase
fitness without sacrificing diversity by fostering specialization followed by
sharing of fit actions. Introducing a leader that broadcasts its actions
throughout the population increases the fitness of actions but reduces
diversity of actions. Increasing the number of leaders reduces this effect.
Efforts are underway to simulate the conditions under which an agent
immigrating from one culture to another contributes new ideas while still
fitting in.

that, for the activities in the 5-14 Hz range, healthy brains exhibit a sparse
connectivity, whereas the brain networks of patients display a rich
connectivity with clear modular structure. Our results suggest that modularity
plays a key role in the functional organization of brain areas during normal
and pathological neural activities at rest.

conformational states before creating a final product molecule, and one often
wishes to identify such intermediate structures from observations of the
product creation. In this paper, we address this problem by solving the
chemical master equations for various enzymatic reactions. We devise a
perturbation theory analogous to that used in quantum mechanics that allows us
to determine the first (&lt;n&gt;) and the second (variance) cumulants of the
distribution of created product molecules as a function of the substrate
concentration and the kinetic rates of the intermediate processes. The mean
product flux V=d&lt;n&gt;/dt (or "dose-response" curve) and the Fano factor
F=variance/&lt;n&gt; are both realistically measurable quantities, and while the mean
flux can often appear the same for different reaction types, the Fano factor
can be quite different. This suggests both qualitative and quantitative ways to
discriminate between different reaction schemes, and we explore this
possibility in the context of four sample multistep enzymatic reactions. We
argue that measuring both the mean flux and the Fano factor can not only
discriminate between reaction types, but can also provide some detailed
information about the internal, unobserved kinetic rates, and this can be done
without measuring single-molecule transition events.

regions with distinct functional abilities. While many factors contribute to
functional specialization, we explore the effect of neuronal density on the
development of neuronal interactions in vitro. Two types of cortical networks,
dense and sparse, with 50,000 and 12,000 total cells respectively, are studied.
Activation graphs that represent pairwise neuronal interactions are constructed
using a competitive first response model. These graphs reveal that, during
development in vitro, dense networks form activation connections earlier than
sparse networks. Link entropy analysis of dense net- work activation graphs
suggests that the majority of connections between electrodes are reciprocal in
nature. Information theoretic measures reveal that early functional information
interactions (among 3 cells) are synergetic in both dense and sparse networks.
However, during later stages of development, previously synergetic
relationships become primarily redundant in dense, but not in sparse networks.
Large link entropy values in the activation graph are related to the domination
of redundant ensembles in late stages of development in dense networks. Results
demonstrate differences between dense and sparse networks in terms of
informational groups, pairwise relationships, and activation graphs. These
differences suggest that variations in cell density may result in different
functional specialization of nervous system tissue in vivo.

force, a discontinuity was recently observed at the supercoiling transition,
when a small plectoneme is suddenly formed. This can be understood as an abrupt
transition into a state in which stretched and plectonemic DNA coexist. We
argue that there should be discontinuities in both the extension and the torque
at the transition, and provide experimental evidence for both. To predict the
sizes of these discontinuities and how they change with the overall length of
DNA, we organize a theory for the coexisting plectonemic state in terms of four
length-independent parameters. We also test plectoneme theories, including our
own elastic rod simulation, finding discrepancies with experiment that can be
understood in terms of the four coexisting state parameters.

often encountered when the characteristics of feedback circuits in the system
are varied. In systems with many unknown or varying parameters, it is an
interesting, but difficult problem to find parameter values for which specific
bifurcations occur. In this paper, we develop a loop breaking approach to
evaluate the influence of parameter values on feedback circuit characteristics.
This approach allows a theoretical classification of feedback circuit
characteristics related to possible bifurcations in the system. Based on the
theoretical results, a numerical algorithm for bifurcation search in a possibly
high-dimensional parameter space is developed. The application of the proposed
algorithm is illustrated by searching for a Hopf bifurcation in a model of the
mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascade, which is a classical example
for biochemical signal transduction.

systems. Here we summarize key aspects of the evolvability and robustness of
the hierarchical network-set of macromolecules, cells, organisms, and
ecosystems. Listing the costs and benefits of cooperation as a necessary
behaviour to build this network hierarchy, we outline the major hypothesis of
the paper: the emergence of hierarchical complexity needs cooperation leading
to the ageing (i.e. gradual deterioration) of the constituent networks. A
stable environment develops cooperation leading to over-optimization, and
forming an "always-old" network, which accumulates damage, and dies in an
apoptosis-like process. A rapidly changing environment develops competition
forming a "forever-young" network, which may suffer an occasional
over-perturbation exhausting system-resources, and causing death in a
necrosis-like process. Giving a number of examples we demonstrate how
cooperation evokes the gradual accumulation of damage typical to ageing.
Finally, we show how various forms of cooperation and consequent ageing emerge
as key elements in all major steps of evolution from the formation of
protocells to the establishment of the globalized, modern human society.

recognized as very interesting for its computational efficiency and its ability
to reproduce many behaviors observed in cortical neurons. For this reason it is
currently widely used, in particular for large scale simulations of neural
networks. This model emulates the dynamics of the membrane potential of a
neuron together with an adaptation variable. The subthreshold dynamics is
governed by a two-parameter differential equation, and a spike is emitted when
the membrane potential variable reaches a given cutoff value. Subsequently the
membrane potential is reset, and the adaptation variable is added a fixed value
called the spike-triggered adaptation parameter. We show in this note that when
the system does not converge to an equilibrium point, both variables of the
subthreshold dynamical system blow up in finite time whatever the parameters of
the dynamics. The cutoff is therefore essential for the model to be well
defined and simulated. The divergence of the adaptation variable makes the
system very sensitive to the cutoff: changing this parameter dramatically
changes the spike patterns produced. Furthermore from a computational
viewpoint, the fact that the adaptation variable blows up and the very sharp
slope it has when the spike is emitted implies that the time step of the
numerical simulation needs to be very small (or adaptive) in order to catch an
accurate value of the adaptation at the time of the spike. It is not the case
for the similar quartic (Touboul 2008) and exponential (Brette and Gerstner
2005) models whose adaptation variable does not blow up in finite time, and
which are therefore very robust to changes in the cutoff value.

network of identical excitatory neurons are fundamentally different from those
of uniformly connected neuronal networks as described by mean-field theory. We
show that (i) the connectivity properties of the networks determines the
location of emergent pacemakers that trigger the firing bursts and (ii) that
the collective desensitization that terminates the firing bursts is determined
again by the network connectivity, through k-core clusters of neurons.

amount of time that has passed since the most recent common ancestor (MRCA) of
all current individuals lived will change as time progresses. The resulting
"MRCA age" process has been studied previously when the population has a
constant large size and evolves via the diffusion limit of standard
Wright--Fisher dynamics. For any population model, the sample paths of the MRCA
age process are made up of periods of linear upward drift with slope +1
punctuated by downward jumps. We build other Markov processes that have such
paths from Poisson point processes on $\mathbb{R}_{++}\times\mathbb{R}_{++}$
with intensity measures of the form $\lambda\otimes\mu$ where $\lambda$ is
Lebesgue measure, and $\mu$ (the "family lifetime measure") is an arbitrary,
absolutely continuous measure satisfying $\mu((0,\infty))=\infty$ and
$\mu((x,\infty))&lt;\infty$ for all $x&gt;0$. Special cases of this construction
describe the time evolution of the MRCA age in $(1+\beta)$-stable continuous
state branching processes conditioned on nonextinction--a particular case of
which, $\beta=1$, is Feller's continuous state branching process conditioned on
nonextinction. As well as the continuous time process, we also consider the
discrete time Markov chain that records the value of the continuous process
just before and after its successive jumps. We find transition probabilities
for both the continuous and discrete time processes, determine when these
processes are transient and recurrent and compute stationary distributions when
they exist.

biochemical logic gates for reduction of the "analog" noise buildup.
Experiments for three coupled enzymatic AND gates are reported, illustrating
our procedure. Specifically, starch - one of the controlled network inputs - is
converted to maltose by beta-amylase. With the use of phosphate (another
controlled input), maltose phosphorylase then produces glucose. Finally,
nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) - the third controlled input - is
reduced under the action of glucose dehydrogenase to yield the optically
detected signal. Network functioning is analyzed by varying selective inputs
and fitting standardized few-parameters "response-surface" functions assumed
for each gate. This allows a certain probe of the individual gate quality, but
primarily yields information on the relative contribution of the gates to noise
amplification. The derived information is then used to modify our experimental
system to put it in a regime of a less noisy operation.

pattern-forming dynamics that starts with the appearance of static spots of
actin on the cell cortex. Spots soon become mobile, executing persistent random
walks, and eventually give rise to traveling waves of actin. Here we describe a
possible physical mechanism for this distinctive set of dynamic
transformations, by equipping an excitable reaction-diffusion model with a
field describing the spatial orientation of its chief constituent (which we
consider to be actin). The interplay of anisotropic actin growth and spatial
inhibition drives a transformation at fixed parameter values from static spots
to moving spots to waves.

On
all scales and at all levels of complexity, relatively independent sub-units
perform relatively independent sub-tasks of biological function. This
functional modularity must be reflected in the topology of molecular networks.
But how a functional module should be represented in an interaction network is
an open question. In protein-interaction networks (PIN), one can identify a
protein-complex as a module on a small scale, i.e. modules are understood as
densely linked, resp. interacting, groups of proteins, that are only sparsely
interacting with the rest of the network.
  In this contribution, we show that extrapolating this concept of cohesively
linked clusters of proteins as modules to the scale of the entire PIN
inevitable misses important and functionally relevant structure inherent in the
network. As an alternative, we introduce a novel way of decomposing a network
into functional roles and show that this represents network structure and
function more efficiently. This finding should have a profound impact on all
module assisted methods of protein function prediction and should shed new
light on how functional modules can be represented in molecular interaction
networks in general.

at its eigenvalues as a probability distribution and then study its Shannon
entropy. Equivalently, we represent a graph with a quantum mechanical state and
study its von Neumann entropy. At the graph-theoretic level, this quantity may
be interpreted as a measure of regularity; it tends to be larger in relation to
the number of connected components, long paths and nontrivial symmetries. When
the set of vertices is asymptotically large, we prove that regular graphs and
the complete graph have equal entropy, and specifically it turns out to be
maximum. On the other hand, when the number of edges is fixed, graphs with
large cliques appear to minimize the entropy.

rate of organisms are still controversial, while resolution may be further
complicated through the use of different and possibly inappropriate approaches
to statistical analysis. We propose the application of a modelling strategy
based on Akaike's information criteria and non-linear model fitting (nlm).
Accordingly, we collated and modelled available data at intraspecific level on
the individual standard metabolic rate of Antarctic microarthropods as a
function of body mass (M), temperature (T), species identity (S) and high rank
taxa to which species belong (G) and tested predictions from Metabolic Scaling
Theory. We also performed allometric analysis based on logarithmic
transformations (lm). Conclusions from lm and nlm approaches were different.
Best-supported models from lm incorporated T, M and S. The estimates of the
allometric scaling exponent b linking body mass and metabolic rate indicated no
interspecific difference and resulted in a value of 0.696 +/- 0.105 (mean +/-
95% CI). In contrast, the four best-supported nlm models suggested that both
the scaling exponent and activation energy significantly vary across the high
rank taxa to which species belong, with mean values of b ranging from about 0.6
to 0.8. We therefore reached two conclusions: 1) published analyses of
arthropod metabolism based on logarithmic data may be biased by data
transformation; 2) non-linear models applied to Antarctic microarthropod
metabolic rate suggest that intraspecific scaling of standard metabolic rate in
Antarctic microarthropods is highly variable and can be characterised by
scaling exponents that greatly vary within taxa, which may have biased previous
interspecific comparisons that neglected intraspecific variability.

epidemic on a general directed and locally finite graph. We assign a
two-dimensional random weight vector to each vertex of the graph in such a way
that the weights of different vertices are i.i.d., but the two entries of the
vector assigned to a vertex need not be independent. The probability for an
edge to be open depends on the weights of its end vertices, but conditionally
on the weights, the states of the edges are independent of each other. In an
epidemiological setting, the vertices of a graph represent the individuals in a
(social) network and the edges represent the connections in the network. The
weights assigned to an individual denote its (random) infectivity and
susceptibility, respectively. We show that one can bound the percolation
probability and the expected size of the cluster of vertices that can be
reached by an open path starting at a given vertex from above and below by the
corresponding quantities for respectively independent bond and site percolation
with certain densities; this generalizes a result of Kuulasmaa. Many models in
the literature are special cases of our general model.

simulated using a rule-based kinetic Monte Carlo method in which a rejection
sampling strategy is used to generate reaction events. This method becomes
inefficient when simulating aggregation processes with large biomolecular
complexes. Here, we present a rejection-free method for determining the
kinetics of multivalent biomolecular interactions, and we apply the method to
simulate simple models for ligand-receptor interactions. Simulation results
show that performance of the rejection-free method is equal to or better than
that of the rejection method over wide parameter ranges, and the rejection-free
method is more efficient for simulating systems in which aggregation is
extensive. The rejection-free method reported here should be useful for
simulating a variety of systems in which multisite molecular interactions yield
large molecular aggregates.

A
stochastic process is defined in which organisms undergo jumps in body size as
they catch and eat smaller organisms. Using a systematic expansion of the
master equation, we derive a deterministic equation for the macroscopic
dynamics, which we call the deterministic jump-growth equation, and a linear
Fokker-Planck equation for the stochastic fluctuations. The McKendrick--von
Foerster equation, used in previous studies, is shown to be a first-order
approximation, appropriate in equilibrium systems where predators are much
larger than their prey. The model has a power-law steady state consistent with
the approximate constancy of mass density in logarithmic intervals of body mass
often observed in marine ecosystems. The behaviours of the stochastic process,
the deterministic jump-growth equation and the McKendrick--von Foerster
equation are compared using numerical methods. The numerical analysis shows two
classes of attractors: steady states and travelling waves.

information among entities in dynamic systems such as living cells or social
communities. While there is a rich literature in estimating a static or
temporally invariant network from observation data, little has been done toward
estimating time-varying networks from time series of entity attributes. In this
paper we present two new machine learning methods for estimating time-varying
networks, which both build on a temporally smoothed $l_1$-regularized logistic
regression formalism that can be cast as a standard convex-optimization problem
and solved efficiently using generic solvers scalable to large networks. We
report promising results on recovering simulated time-varying networks. For
real data sets, we reverse engineer the latent sequence of temporally rewiring
political networks between Senators from the US Senate voting records and the
latent evolving regulatory networks underlying 588 genes across the life cycle
of Drosophila melanogaster from the microarray time course.

actors can undergo large and systematic changes. In this paper we propose a
model-based approach to analyze what we will refer to as the dynamic tomography
of such time-evolving networks. Our approach offers an intuitive but powerful
tool to infer the semantic underpinnings of each actor, such as its social
roles or biological functions, underlying the observed network topologies. Our
model builds on earlier work on a mixed membership stochastic blockmodel for
static networks, and the state-space model for tracking object trajectory. It
overcomes a major limitation of many current network inference techniques,
which assume that each actor plays a unique and invariant role that accounts
for all its interactions with other actors; instead, our method models the role
of each actor as a time-evolving mixed membership vector that allows actors to
behave differently over time and carry out different roles/functions when
interacting with different peers, which is closer to reality. We present an
efficient algorithm for approximate inference and learning using our model; and
we applied our model to analyze a social network between monks (i.e., the
Sampson's network), a dynamic email communication network between the Enron
employees, and a rewiring gene interaction network of fruit fly collected
during its full life cycle. In all cases, our model reveals interesting
patterns of the dynamic roles of the actors.

discuss the mechanism of epigenetic landscape. In our simplified model, a
minimal model, the network of the interaction among cells generates the
landscape epigenetically and the differentiation in developmental process is
understood as a self-organization. The effect of the regulation by gene
expression which is a key ingredient in development is renormalized into the
interaction and the environment. At earlier stage of the development the energy
landscape of the model is rugged with small amplitude. The state of cells in
such a landscape is susceptible to fluctuations and not uniquely determined.
These cells are regarded as stem cells. At later stage of the development the
landscape has a funnel-like structure corresponding to the canalization in
differentiation. The rewinding or stability of the differentiation is also
demonstrated by substituting test cells into the time sequence of the model
development.

networks based on random walks with damping was formulated with two fundamental
modes: emitting and absorbing. While many other network analysis methods based
on random walks or equivalent notions have been developed before and after our
earlier work, one can show that they can all be mapped to one of the two modes.
In addition to these two fundamental modes, a major strength of our earlier
formalism was its accommodation of context-specific directed information flow
that yielded plausible and meaningful biological interpretation of protein
functions and pathways. However, the directed flow from origins to destinations
was induced via a potential function that was heuristic. Here, with a
theoretically sound approach called the channel mode, we extend our earlier
work for directed information flow. This is achieved by constructing a
potential function facilitating a purely probabilistic interpretation of the
channel mode. For each network node, the channel mode combines the solutions of
emitting and absorbing modes in the same context, producing what we call a
channel tensor. The entries of the channel tensor at each node can be
interpreted as the amount of flow passing through that node from an origin to a
destination. Similarly to our earlier model, the channel mode encompasses
damping as a free parameter that controls the locality of information flow.
Through examples involving the yeast pheromone response pathway, we illustrate
the versatility and stability of our new framework.

the cell. Our current quantitative understanding of how multiple motors move
along a single track is not complete; even though models and theories for
single motor chemomechanics abound. Recently, M.J.I. M$\ddot{\rm u}$ller {\em
et al.} have developed a tug-of-war model to describe the bidirectional
movement of the cargo (PNAS(2008) 105(12) P4609-4614). Through Monte Carlo
simulations, they discovered that the tug-of-war model exhibits several
qualitative different motility regimes, which depend on the precise value of
single motor parameters, and they suggested the sensitivity can be used by a
cell to regulate its cargo traffic. In the present paper, we carry out a
thorough analysis of the tug-of-war model. All the stable, i.e., biophysically
observable, steady states are obtained. Depending on several parameters, the
system exhibits either uni-, bi- or tristability. Based on the separating
boundary of the different stable states and the initial numbers of the
different motor species that are bound to the track, the steady state of the
cargo movement can be predicted, and consequently the steady state velocity can
be obtained. It is found that, the velocity, even the direction, of the cargo
movement change with the initial numbers of the motors which are bound to the
track and several other parameters.

enables many species of bacteria to swim. Torque is generated by interaction of
stator units, anchored to the peptidoglycan cell wall, with the rotor. Recent
experiments [Yuan, J. &amp; Berg, H. C. (2008) PNAS 105, 1182-1185] show that near
zero load the speed of the motor is independent of the number of stators. Here,
we introduce a mathematical model of the motor dynamics that explains this
behavior based on a general assumption that the stepping rate of a stator
depends on the torque exerted by the stator on the rotor. We find that the
motor dynamics can be characterized by two time scales: the moving-time
interval for the mechanical rotation of the rotor and the waiting-time interval
determined by the chemical transitions of the stators. We show that these two
time scales depend differently on the load, and that their crossover provides
the microscopic explanation for the existence of two regimes in the
torque-speed curves observed experimentally. We also analyze the speed
fluctuation for a single motor using our model. We show that the motion is
smoothed by having more stator units. However, the mechanism for such
fluctuation reduction is different depending on the load. We predict that the
speed fluctuation is determined by the number of steps per revolution only at
low load and is controlled by external noise for high load. Our model can be
generalized to study other molecular motor systems with multiple
power-generating units.

infinite-dimensional parameter spaces with independent or Markovian data.
Necessary conditions for consistency include the prior putting enough weight on
the correct neighborhoods of the data-generating distribution; various
sufficient conditions further restrict the prior in ways analogous to capacity
control in frequentist nonparametrics. The asymptotics of Bayesian updating
with mis-specified models or priors, or non-Markovian data, are far less well
explored. Here I establish sufficient conditions for posterior convergence when
all hypotheses are wrong, and the data have complex dependencies. The main
dynamical assumption is the asymptotic equipartition (Shannon-McMillan-Breiman)
property of information theory. This, along with Egorov's Theorem on uniform
convergence, lets me build a sieve-like structure for the prior. The main
statistical assumption, also a form of capacity control, concerns the
compatibility of the prior and the data-generating process, controlling the
fluctuations in the log-likelihood when averaged over the sieve-like sets. In
addition to posterior convergence, I derive a kind of large deviations
principle for the posterior measure, extending in some cases to rates of
convergence, and discuss the advantages of predicting using a combination of
models known to be wrong. An appendix sketches connections between these
results and the replicator dynamics of evolutionary theory.

different species that are often observed in birds, primates and cetaceans.
They have been interpreted as a strategy to reduce predation risk, enhance
foraging success and/or provide a social advantage. In the archipelago of the
Azores, four species of dolphins are commonly involved in mixed-species
associations: the common dolphin, Delphinus delphis, the bottlenose dolphin,
Tursiops truncatus, the striped dolphin, Stenella coeruleoalba, and the spotted
dolphin, Stenella frontalis. In order to understand the reasons why dolphins
associate, we analysed field data collected since 1999 by research scientists
and trained observers placed onboard fishing vessels. In total, 113
mixed-species groups were observed out of 5720 sightings. The temporal
distribution, habitat (water depth, distance to the coast), behaviour (i.e.
feeding, travelling, socializing), size and composition of mixed-species groups
were compared with those of single-species groups. Results did not support the
predation avoidance hypothesis and gave little support to the social advantage
hypothesis. The foraging advantage hypothesis was the most convincing. However,
the benefits of mixed-species associations appeared to depend on the species.
Associations were likely to be opportunistic in the larger bottlenose dolphin,
while there seemed to be some evolutionary constraints favouring associations
in the rarer striped dolphin. Comparison with previous studies suggests that
the formation of mixed-species groups depends on several environmental factors,
and therefore may constitute an adaptive response.

demographic structure: for a bottleneck model, a population-divergence model,
and for a two-island model with migration. The sequential Markov coalescent
method is an approximation to the coalescent suggested by McVean and Cardin,
and Marjoram and Wall. Within this algorithm we compute, for two individuals
randomly sampled from the population, the correlation between times to the most
recent common ancestor and the linkage probability corresponding to two
different loci with recombination rate R between them. We find that the
sequential Markov coalescent method approximates the coalescent well in general
in models with demographic structure. An exception is the case where
individuals are sampled from populations separated by reduced gene flow. In
this situation, the gene-history correlations may be significantly
underestimated. We explain why this is the case.

issue of whether or not there have been long term cycles (operating over tens
of millions of years) in biodiversity and extinction. Here we consider the
history of this debate by connecting the skein from Grabau up to 2008. We focus
on the evidence for periodicity that has emerged thus far, and conclude that
there is indeed some evidence that periodicity may be real, though of course
more work is needed. We also comment on possible causal mechanisms, focusing
especially on the motion of our solar system in the Galaxy. Moreover, we
consider the reasons why some scientists have opposed periodicity over the
years. Finally, we consider the significance of this for our understanding of
evolution and the history of life.

protein sequences. The main question studied is the design of efficient seed
alphabets to construct seeds with optimal sensitivity/selectivity trade-offs.
We propose several different design methods and use them to construct several
alphabets. We then perform a comparative analysis of seeds built over those
alphabets and compare them with the standard BLASTP seeding method [2], [3], as
well as with the family of vector seeds proposed in [4]. While the formalism of
subset seeds is less expressive (but less costly to implement) than the
cumulative principle used in BLASTP and vector seeds, our seeds show a similar
or even better performance than BLASTP on Bernoulli models of proteins
compatible with the common BLOSUM62 matrix. Finally, we perform a large-scale
benchmarking of our seeds against several main databases of protein alignments.
Here again, the results show a comparable or better performance of our seeds
vs. BLASTP.

of sires consistent with the multi-locus genotypes of a mother and her progeny.
We consider cases where a simple exhaustive search through all possible sets of
sires is impossible in practice (because it would take too long to complete).
Our algorithm for solving this combinatorial optimisation problem avoids
visiting large parts of search space which would not improve the solution found
so far (i.e., result in a solution with fewer number of sires). This is of
particular importance when the number of allelic types in the progeny array is
large and when the minimum number of sires is expected to be large. Precisely
in such cases it is important to know the minimum number of sires: this number
gives an exact bound on the most likely number of sires estimated by a random
search algorithm in a parameter region where it may be difficult to determine
whether it has converged. We apply our algorithm to data from the marine snail,
Littorina saxatilis.

as its deterministic continuous limit. Such model can be divided into two
phases: reproduction followed by neutral selection. This result suggests that
Eigen model describes the competition among individuals differing for
reproductive capability but equivalent as survivors. We explicitly write down
the Markov matrix of the stochastic model in the two species case and compute
numerically the master sequence concentration for various values of the total
population. Finally we compare our results with those obtained with Eigen model
and with Nowak and Schuster birth and death model.

their repair have been implicated in neurological disease. While much progress
has been made in understanding how chromosomal single strand breaks are
repaired little is known about the changes chromatin structure that accompany
this process. Here, we show that nascent recombinant histone H3.1 protein
accumulates and is deposited into chromatin at sites of DNA strand breakage in
quiescent human cells following oxidative stress, and that core components of
the single-strand break repair machinery are required for this process. We show
that the SSBR sensor and scaffold proteins poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase and
XRCC1 facilitate accumulation of chromatin assembly factor-1 (CAF-1) at sites
of oxidative DNA strand breakage, which in turn mediates the deposition of
Histone H3.1. We also demonstrate that depletion of CAF-1 slows global rates of
DNA strand break repair in quiescent cells following oxidative stress,
demonstrating that single-strand break repair and histone deposition are
tightly coordinated processes. These data describe a novel role for the DNA
singlestrand break repair machinery and implicate histone turnover as a core
component of the cellular response of quiescent cells to oxidative damage.

synaptic stimuli on the firing times of a neuron oscillator without the
assumption of weak coupling. They allow us to approximate the dynamics of
synchronous state in networks of neurons through a discrete map. Linearization
about the fixed point of the discrete map can then be used to predict the
stability of patterns of synchrony in the network. General theory for taking
into account the contribution from higher order STRC terms, in the
approximation of the discrete map for coupled neuronal oscillators in synchrony
is still lacking. Here we present a general framework to account for higher
order STRC corrections in the approximation of discrete map to determine the
domain of 1:1 phase locking state in the network of two interacting neurons. We
begin by demonstrating that the effect of synaptic stimuli through a shunting
synapse to a neuron firing in the gamma frequency band (20-80 Hz) last for
three consecutive firing cycles. We then show that the discrete map derived by
taking into account the higher order STRC contributions is successfully able
predict the domain of synchronous 1:1 phase locked state in a network of two
heterogeneous interneurons coupled through a shunting synapse.

that has been used to model cardiovascular phenomena. We derive exact analytic
conditions that allow the prediction of OD through the two known bifurcation
routes, in the same model, and for different numbers of coupled oscillators.
Our exact analytic results enable us to generalize OD as a
multiparameter-sensitive phenomenon. It can be induced, not only by changes in
couplings, but also by changes in the oscillator frequencies or amplitudes. We
observe synchronization transitions as a function of coupling and confirm the
robustness of the phenomena in the presence of noise. Numerical and analogue
simulations are in good agreement with the theory.

proteins to locate specific target sites on a DNA within seconds and on the
formation of long lived (many minutes) complexes between these proteins and the
DNA. Equilibrium experiments show that indeed regulatory proteins bind tightly
to their target site. However, they also find strong binding to other
non-specific sites which act as traps that can dramatically increase the time
needed to locate the target. This gives rise to a conflict between the speed
and stability requirements. Here we suggest a simple mechanism which can
resolve this long-standing paradox by allowing the target sites to be located
by proteins within short time scales even in the presence of traps. Our
theoretical analysis shows that the mechanism is robust in the presence of
generic disorder in the DNA sequence and does not require a specially designed
target site.

to regulate as high as 90% of the coding genes in human. The diversity and
abundance of miRNA targets offer an enormous level of combinatorial
possibilities and suggest that miRNAs and their targets form a complex
regulatory network. In the present study, we analyzed 711 miRNAs and their 34,
525 predicted targets in the miRBase database which generate a complex
bipartite network having numerous numbers of genes forming the hub. Genes at
the hub (total 9877) are significantly over represented in genes with specific
molecular functions, biological processes and biological pathways as revealed
from the analysis using PANTHER. We further construct a miRNA co-target network
by linking every pair of miRNAs which co-target at least one gene. The weight
of the link, which is taken to be the number of co-targets of the pair of
miRNAs vary widely, and we could erase several links while keeping the relevant
features of the network intact. The largest connected sub-graph, thus obtained,
contains 479 miRNAs. More than 75% of the miRNAs deregulated in 15 different
diseases collected from published data are found to be in this largest sub
graph. We further analyze this sub-graph to obtain 70 small clusters containing
total 330 miRNAs of 479. We identified the biological pathways where the
co-targeted genes in the clusters are significantly over- represented in
comparison to that obtained with that are not co-targeted by the miRNAs in the
cluster. Using published data, we identified that specific clusters of miRNAs
are associated with specific diseases by altering particular pathways. We
propose that instead of single miRNA, clusters of miRNA that co-targets the
genes are important for the regulation of miRNA in diseases.

eye) cell with myriad of nuclei. The plasmodium is a promising substrate for
non-classical, nature-inspired, computing devices. It is capable for
approximation of shortest path, computation of planar proximity graphs and
plane tessellations, primitive memory and decision-making. The unique
properties of the plasmodium make it an ideal candidate for a role of amorphous
biological robots with massive parallel information processing and distributed
inputs and outputs. We show that when adhered to light-weight object resting on
a water surface the plasmodium can propel the object by oscillating its
protoplasmic pseudopodia. In experimental laboratory conditions and
computational experiments we study phenomenology of the plasmodium-floater
system, and possible mechanisms of controlling motion of objects propelled by
on board plasmodium.

graph-theoretic, optimization and computational geometry problems due to its
unique foraging behavior. Also the plasmodium is unique biological substrate
that mimics universal storage modification machines, namely the
Kolmogorov-Uspensky machine. In the plasmodium implementation of the storage
modification machine data are represented by sources of nutrients and memory
structure by protoplasmic tubes connecting the sources. In laboratory
experiments and simulation we demonstrate how the plasmodium-based storage
modification machine can be programmed. We show execution of the following
operations with active zone (where computation occurs): merge two active zones,
multiple active zone, translate active zone from one data site to another,
direct active zone. Results of the paper bear two-fold value: they provide a
basis for programming unconventional devices based on biological substrates and
also shed light on behavioral patterns of the plasmodium.

buccal epithelium under the influence of stressing factor - dosed physical
activity. Investigations were performed in a group of students (13 men) of age
19-23. Cells were stained on a slide by a 2% orcein solution in 45% acetic acid
during 1 h. The following physiological indexes were determined: arterial blood
pressure, pulse frequency, and frequency of breathing. The physical stress
produced by the dosed physical activity causes the considerable increase of
degree of heterochromatinization in the cell nuclei of human buccal epithelium.
As a rule, the level of heterochromatinization increases after first stage of
training, but in some donors it increases significantly only after the second
stage of training.

branch of biology. While there have been few previous attempts to (implicitly)
model various facets of biological context-dependence, a formal and general
mathematical construct to model the wide spectrum of context-dependence, eludes
the students of biology. An objective and rigorous model, from both 'bottom-up'
as well as 'top-down' perspective, is proposed here to serve as the template to
describe the various kinds of context-dependence that we encounter in different
branches of biology. Interactions between biological contexts was found to be
transitive but non-commutative. It is found that a hierarchical nature of
dependence amongst the biological contexts models the emergent biological
properties efficiently. Reasons for these findings are provided with a general
model to describe biological reality. Scheme to algorithmically implement the
hierarchic structure of organization of biological contexts was achieved with a
construct named 'Context tree'. A 'Context tree' based analysis of context
interactions among biophysical factors influencing protein structure was
performed.

regulation and tissue stability. We show that competition between surface and
bulk effects leads to the existence of a critical size that must be overcome by
metastases to reach macroscopic sizes. This property can qualitatively explain
the observed size distributions of metastases, while size-independent growth
rates cannot account for clinical and experimental data. In addition, it
potentially explains the observed preferential growth of metastases on tissue
surfaces and membranes such as the pleural and peritoneal layers, suggests a
mechanism underlying the seed and soil hypothesis introduced by Stephen Paget
in 1889 and yields realistic values for metastatic inefficiency. We propose a
number of key experiments to test these concepts. The homeostatic pressure as
introduced in this work could constitute a quantitative, experimentally
accessible measure for the metastatic potential of early malignant growths.

defines the neuron's coding strategy. This is frequently and effectively
modeled phenomenologically by one or more linear filters that extract the
components of the stimulus that are relevant for triggering spikes, and a
nonlinear function that relates stimulus to firing probability. In many sensory
systems, these two components of the coding strategy are found to adapt to
changes in the statistics of the inputs, in such a way as to improve
information transmission. Here, we show for two simple neuron models how
feature selectivity as captured by the spike-triggered average depends both on
the parameters of the model and on the statistical characteristics of the
input.

roughness of binding sites of proteins have long been considered as useful
markers to identify functional sites of proteins. However, an algorithm that
describes the connection between the simultaneous changes of these important
parameters - eludes the students of structural biology. Here a simple yet
general mathematical scheme is proposed that attempts to achieve the same.
Instead of n-dimensional random vector description, protein surface roughness
is described here as a system of algebraic equations. Such description resulted
in the construction of a generalized index that not only describes the
shape-change-vs-surface-roughness-change process but also reduces the
estimation error in local shape characterization. Suitable algorithmic
implementation of it in context-specific macromolecular recognition can be
attempted easily. Contemporary drug discovery studies will be enormously
benefited from this work because it is the first algorithm that can estimate
the change in protein surface roughness as the local shape of the protein is
changing (and vice-versa).

to develop a lattice model that can be employed to theoretically describe
properties of chiral, unbranched homopolymers. We find that in its low
temperature phase the model is in the same universality class with proteins
that are deposited in the Protein Data Bank, in the sense of the compactness
index. We apply the model to analyze various statistical aspects of folded
proteins. Curiously we find that it can produce results that are a very good
good match to the data in the Protein Data Bank.

exists a way to select a unique parent of each hybrid vertex resulting in the
tree T. Let Tr(N) denote the set of all trees displayed by the network N. In
general, there may be many other networks M such that Tr(M) = Tr(N). A network
is regular if it is isomorphic with its cover digraph. This paper shows that if
N is regular, there is a procedure to reconstruct N given Tr(N). Hence if N and
M are regular networks and Tr(N) = Tr(M), it follows that N = M, proving that a
regular network is uniquely determined by its displayed trees.

piconewton range and nanometer scale. They convert chemical energy into
mechanical work by moving along filamentous structures. In this paper, we study
the velocity of two-head molecular motors in the framework of a mechanochemical
network theory. The network model, a generalization of the recently work of
Liepelt and Lipowsky (PRL 98, 258102 (2007)), is based on the discrete
mechanochemical states of a molecular motor with multiple cycles. By
generalizing the mathematical method developed by Fisher and Kolomeisky for
single cycle motor (PNAS(2001) 98(14) P7748-7753), we are able to obtain an
explicit formula for the velocity of a molecular motor.

the context of recent measurements of firing dynamics in 2D neuronal cultures.
There are two regimes, depending on the graph size N. Large metric graphs are
ignited by the occurrence of critical nuclei, which initially occupy an
infinitesimal fraction, f_* -&gt; 0, of the graph and then explode throughout a
finite fraction. Smaller metric graphs are effectively random in the sense that
their ignition requires the initial ignition of a finite, unlocalized fraction
of the graph, f_* &gt;0. The crossover between the two regimes is at a size N_*
which scales exponentially with the connectivity range \lambda like_* \sim
\exp\lambda^d. The neuronal cultures are finite metric graphs of size N \simeq
10^5-10^6, which, for the parameters of the experiment, is effectively random
since N&lt;&lt; N_*. This explains the seeming contradiction in the observed finite
f_* in these cultures. Finally, we discuss the dynamics of the firing front.

wave-train. However, simple physical arguments suggest that vortices anchored
to large inexcitable obstacles cannot be removed similarly. We show that
unpinning of vortices attached to obstacles smaller than the core radius of the
free vortex is possible through pacing. The wave-train frequency necessary for
unpinning increases with the obstacle size and we present a geometric
explanation of this dependence. Our model-independent results suggest that
decreasing excitability of the medium can facilitate pacing-induced removal of
vortices in cardiac tissue.

most neurons have been shown to exhibit dendritic excitability through the
expression of a variety of voltage-gated ion channels. However, despite
experimental and theoretical efforts undertaken in the last decades, the role
of this excitability for some kind of dendritic computation has remained
elusive. Here we show that, owing to very general properties of excitable
media, the average output of a model of active dendritic trees is a highly
non-linear function of their afferent rate, attaining extremely large dynamic
ranges (above 50 dB). Moreover, the model yields double-sigmoid response
functions as experimentally observed in retinal ganglion cells. We claim that
enhancement of dynamic range is the primary functional role of active dendritic
conductances. We predict that neurons with larger dendritic trees should have
larger dynamic range and that blocking of active conductances should lead to a
decrease of dynamic range.

provides a new insight to some problems of genetics, in particular, generacy of
the genetic code and the structure of the PAM matrix in bioinformatics. The
2-adic distance is an ultrametric and applications of ultrametrics in
bioinformatics are not surprising. However, by using the 2-adic numbers we
match ultrametric with a number theoretic structure. In this way we find new
applications of an ultrametric which differ from known up to now in
bioinformatics.
  We obtain the following results. We show that the PAM matrix A allows the
expansion into the sum of the two matrices A=A^{(2)}+A^{(\infty)}, where the
matrix A^{(2)} is 2-adically regular (i.e. matrix elements of this matrix are
close to locally constant with respect to the discussed earlier by the authors
2-adic parametrization of the genetic code), and the matrix A^{(\infty)} is
sparse. We discuss the structure of the matrix A^{(\infty)} in relation to the
side chain properties of the corresponding amino acids.

the problem into one of finding the shortest path through a certain region of

point in the all negative orthant of R^k contained in the subspace of R^k
consisting of all orthants with the first i coordinates non-positive and the

are altered in response to external input. Experience-dependent structural
changes in cortical microcurcuts lead to changes of activity, i.e. to changes
in information encoded. Specific patterns of external stimulation can lead to
creation of new synaptic connections between neurons. The calcium influxes
controlled by neuronal activity regulate the processes of neurotrophic factors
released by neurons, growth cones movement and synapse differentiation in
developing neural systems. We propose a model for description and investigation
of the activity dependent development of neural networks. The dynamics of the
network parameters (activity, diffusion of axon guidance chemicals, growth cone
position) is described by a closed set of differential equations. The model
presented here describes the development of neural networks under the
assumption of activity dependent axon guidance molecules. Numerical simulation
shows that morpholess neurons compromise the development of cortical
connectivity.

living organisms. Whereas biologists have proposed models where the shape is
controlled on a molecular level [1], physicists, following Turing [2] and
d'Arcy Thomson [3], have developed theories where patterns arise spontaneously
[4]. Here, we propose a volume constraint that restricts the possible shapes of
leaves. Focusing on palmate leaves, the central observation is that developing
leaves first grow folded inside a bud, limited by the previous and subsequent
leaves. We show that growing folded in this small volume controls globally the
leaf development. This induces a direct relationship between the way it was
folded and the final unfolded shape of the leaf. These dependencies can be
approximated as simple geometrical relationships that we confirm on both folded
embryonic and unfolded mature leaves. We find that independently of their
position in the phylogenetic tree, these relationships work for folded species,
but do not work for non-folded species. This steric constraint is a simple way
to impose a global regulation for the leaf growth. Such steric regulation
should be more general and considered as a new simple means of global
regulation.

neocortical interactions (SMNI), are investigated for conditions of oscillatory
processing at frequencies consistent with observed electroencephalography
(EEG). Direct calculations of the Euler-Lagrange (EL) equations which are
derived from functional variation of the SMNI probability distribution, giving
most likely states of the system, are performed for three prototypical Cases,
dominate excitatory columnar firings, dominate inhibitory columnar firings, and
in-between balanced columnar firings, with and without a Centering mechanism
(CM) (based on observed changes in stochastic background of presynaptic
interactions) which pulls more stable states into the physical firings ranges.
Only states with the CM exhibit robust support for these oscillatory states.
These calculations are repeated for the visual neocortex, which has twice as
many neurons/minicolumn as other neocortical regions. These calculations argue
that robust columnar support for common EEG activity requires the same columnar
presynaptic parameter necessary for ideal short-term memory (STM). It is
demonstrated at this columnar scale, that both shifts in local columnar
presynaptic background as well as local or global regional oscillatory
interactions can effect or be affected by attractors that have detailed
experimental support to be considered states of STM. Including the CM with
other proposed mechanisms for columnar-glial interactions and for
glial-presynaptic background interactions, a path for future investigations is
outlined to test for quantum interactions, enhanced by magnetic fields from
columnar EEG, that directly support cerebral STM and computation by controlling
presynaptic noise.

  (2010)</journal-ref><license>http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/</license><abstract>  The human brain is autonomously active, being characterized by a
self-sustained neural activity which would be present even in the absence of
external sensory stimuli. Here we study the interrelation between the
self-sustained activity in autonomously active recurrent neural nets and
external sensory stimuli.
  There is no a priori semantical relation between the influx of external
stimuli and the patterns generated internally by the autonomous and ongoing
brain dynamics. The question then arises when and how are semantic correlations
between internal and external dynamical processes learned and built up?
  We study this problem within the paradigm of transient state dynamics for the
neural activity in recurrent neural nets, i.e. for an autonomous neural
activity characterized by an infinite time-series of transiently stable
attractor states. We propose that external stimuli will be relevant during the
sensitive periods, {\it viz} the transition period between one transient state
and the subsequent semi-stable attractor. A diffusive learning signal is
generated unsupervised whenever the stimulus influences the internal dynamics
qualitatively.
  For testing we have presented to the model system stimuli corresponding to
the bars and stripes problem. We found that the system performs a non-linear
independent component analysis on its own, being continuously and autonomously
active. This emergent cognitive capability results here from a general
principle for the neural dynamics, the competition between neural ensembles.

  journal for review</comments><license>http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/</license><abstract>  For a set of mulitple sequences, their patterns,Longest Common Subsequences
(LCS) and Shortest Common Supersequences (SCS) represent different aspects of
these sequences profile, and they can all be used for biological sequence
comparisons and analysis. Revealing the relationship between the patterns and
LCS,SCS might provide us with a deeper view of the patterns of biological
sequences, in turn leading to better understanding of them. However, There is
no careful examinaton about the relationship between patterns, LCS and SCS. In
this paper, we have analyzed their relation, and given some lemmas. Based on
their relations, a set of algorithms called the PALS (PAtterns by Lcs and Scs)
algorithms are propsoed to discover patterns in a set of biological sequences.
These algorithms first generate the results for LCS and SCS of sequences by
heuristic, and consequently derive patterns from these results. Experiments
show that the PALS algorithms perform well (both in efficiency and in accuracy)
on a variety of sequences. The PALS approach also provides us with a solution
for transforming between the heuristic results of SCS and LCS.

outbreaks and recently Britton and Lindenstrand \cite{BL} described the case
when latency and infectivity have independent gamma distributions. They found
that variability in these random variables had opposite effects on the epidemic
growth rate. That rate increased with greater variability in latency but
decreased with greater variability in infectivity. Here we extend their result
by using the McKay bivariate gamma distribution for the joint distribution of
latency and infectivity, recovering the above effects of variability but
allowing possible correlation. We use methods of stochastic rate processes to
obtain explicit solutions for the growth of the epidemic and the evolution of
the inhomogeneity and information entropy. We obtain a closed analytic solution
to the evolution of the distribution of the number of uninfected individuals as
the epidemic proceeds, and a concomitant expression for the decay of entropy.
The family of McKay bivariate gamma distributions has a tractable information
geometry which provides a framework in which the evolution of distributions can
be studied as the outbreak grows, with a natural distance structure for
quantitative tracking of progress.

issues such as spike timing reliability, network synchronization, and neuronal
coding. These measures can broadly be divided in multivariate measures and
averages over bivariate measures. One of the most recent bivariate approaches,
the ISI-distance, employs the ratio of instantaneous interspike intervals. In
this study we propose two extensions of the ISI-distance, the straightforward
averaged bivariate ISI-distance and the multivariate ISI-diversity based on the
coefficient of variation. Like the original measure these extensions combine
many properties desirable in applications to real data. In particular, they are
parameter free, time scale independent, and easy to visualize in a
time-resolved manner, as we illustrate with in vitro recordings from a cortical
neuron. Using a simulated network of Hindemarsh-Rose neurons as a controlled
configuration we compare the performance of our methods in distinguishing
different levels of multi-neuron spike train synchrony to the performance of
six other previously published measures. We show and explain why the averaged
bivariate measures perform better than the multivariate ones and why the
multivariate ISI-diversity is the best performer among the multivariate
methods. Finally, in a comparison against standard methods that rely on moving
window estimates, we use single-unit monkey data to demonstrate the advantages
of the instantaneous nature of our methods.

objects, unifying the study of diverse phenomena including biological organisms
and human society. One crucial step when studying the structure and dynamics of
networks is to identify communities: groups of related nodes that correspond to
functional subunits such as protein complexes or social spheres. Communities in
networks often overlap such that nodes simultaneously belong to several groups.
Meanwhile, many networks are known to possess hierarchical organization, where
communities are recursively grouped into a hierarchical structure. However, the
fact that many real networks have communities with pervasive overlap, where
each and every node belongs to more than one group, has the consequence that a
global hierarchy of nodes cannot capture the relationships between overlapping
groups. Here we reinvent communities as groups of links rather than nodes and
show that this unorthodox approach successfully reconciles the antagonistic
organizing principles of overlapping communities and hierarchy. In contrast to
the existing literature, which has entirely focused on grouping nodes, link
communities naturally incorporate overlap while revealing hierarchical
organization. We find relevant link communities in many networks, including
major biological networks such as protein-protein interaction and metabolic
networks, and show that a large social network contains hierarchically
organized community structures spanning inner-city to regional scales while
maintaining pervasive overlap. Our results imply that link communities are
fundamental building blocks that reveal overlap and hierarchical organization
in networks to be two aspects of the same phenomenon.

Physiol., Paris, 104, (1-2), 5-18, (2010)</journal-ref><license>http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/</license><abstract>  In this article, our wish is to demystify some aspects of coding with
spike-timing, through a simple review of well-understood technical facts
regarding spike coding. The goal is to help better understanding to which
extend computing and modelling with spiking neuron networks can be biologically
plausible and computationally efficient. We intentionally restrict ourselves to
a deterministic dynamics, in this review, and we consider that the dynamics of
the network is defined by a non-stochastic mapping. This allows us to stay in a
rather simple framework and to propose a review with concrete numerical values,
results and formula on (i) general time constraints, (ii) links between
continuous signals and spike trains, (iii) spiking networks parameter
adjustments. When implementing spiking neuron networks, for computational or
biological simulation purposes, it is important to take into account the
indisputable facts here reviewed. This precaution could prevent from
implementing mechanisms meaningless with regards to obvious time constraints,
or from introducing spikes artificially, when continuous calculations would be
sufficient and simpler. It is also pointed out that implementing a spiking
neuron network is finally a simple task, unless complex neural codes are
considered.

of simple interaction rules among individuals: each animal deploys itself
depending on the position of a limited number of close group mates. The
proposed model is shown to produce clustered formations, as well as lines and
V-like formations. The key factors which trigger the onset of different
patterns are argued to be the relative strength of attraction and repulsion
forces and, most important, the anisotropy in their application.

differentiate, cells must control the concentrations of the myriad different
proteins that are encoded in the genome. The precision of this control is
limited by the inevitable randomness of individual molecular events. Here we
explore how cells can maximize their control power in the presence of these
physical limits; formally, we solve the theoretical problem of maximizing the
information transferred from inputs to outputs when the number of available
molecules is held fixed. We start with the simplest version of the problem, in
which a single transcription factor protein controls the readout of one or more
genes by binding to DNA. We further simplify by assuming that this regulatory
network operates in steady state, that the noise is small relative to the
available dynamic range, and that the target genes do not interact. Even in
this simple limit, we find a surprisingly rich set of optimal solutions.
Importantly, for each locally optimal regulatory network, all parameters are
determined once the physical constraints on the number of available molecules
are specified. Although we are solving an over--simplified version of the
problem facing real cells, we see parallels between the structure of these
optimal solutions and the behavior of actual genetic regulatory networks.
Subsequent papers will discuss more complete versions of the problem.

Computational

produces another, more organized form of order. We propose a formal scheme to
calculate robustness of an entire biological system by quantifying the negative
entropy present in it. Our Methodology is based upon a computational
implementation of two-person non-cooperative finite zero-sum game between
positive (physico-chemical) and negative (biological) entropy, present in the
system(TCA cycle, for this work). Biochemical analogue of Nash equilibrium,
proposed here, could measure the robustness in TCA cycle in exact numeric
terms, whereas the mixed strategy game between these entropies could quantitate
the progression of stages of biological adaptation. Synchronization profile
amongst macromolecular concentrations (even under environmental perturbations)
is found to account for negative entropy and biological robustness. Emergence
of synchronization profile was investigated with dynamically varying metabolite
concentrations. Obtained results were verified with that from the deterministic
simulation methods. Categorical plans to apply this algorithm in Cancer studies
and anti-viral therapies are proposed alongside. From theoretical perspective,
this work proposes a general, rigorous and alternative view of immunology.

division, in which each of a pair of duplicated chromosomes is attached through
microtubules to centrosomal bodies located close to the two poles of the
dividing cell. Several mechanisms are at work towards the formation of the
spindle, one of which is the `capture' of chromosome pairs, held together by
kinetochores, by randomly searching microtubules. Although the entire cell
cycle can be up to 24 hours long, the mitotic phase typically takes only less
than an hour. How does the cell keep the duration of mitosis within this limit?
Previous theoretical studies have suggested that the chromosome search and
capture is optimized by tuning the microtubule dynamic parameters to minimize
the search time. In this paper, we examine this conjecture. We compute the mean
search time for a single target by microtubules from a single nucleating site,
using a systematic and rigorous theoretical approach, for arbitrary kinetic
parameters. The result is extended to multiple targets and nucleating sites by
physical arguments. Estimates of mitotic time scales are then obtained for
different cells using experimental data. In yeast and mammalian cells, the
observed changes in microtubule kinetics between interphase and mitosis are
beneficial in reducing the search time. In {\it Xenopus} extracts, by contrast,
the opposite effect is observed, in agreement with the current understanding
that large cells use additional mechanisms to regulate the duration of the
mitotic phase.

obtained from sociological or biological data for instance, has become a major
field of interest in the last decade. One way to deal with it is to consider
that networks are built from small functional units called {\em motifs}, which
can be found by looking for small subgraphs whose numbers of occurrences in the
whole network of interest are surprisingly high. In this paper, we propose to
define motifs through a local over-representation in the network and develop a
statistic which allows us to detect them limiting the number of false positives
and without time-consuming simulations. We apply it to the Yeast gene
interaction data and show that the known biologically relevant motifs are found
again and that our method gives some more information than the existing ones.

post-mortem interval (PMI$_{min}$) by forensic entomologists. The age of the
most developed insect larvae (mostly blow fly larvae) gives reasonably reliable
information about the minimum time a person has been dead. Methods such as
isomegalen diagrams or ADH calculations can have problems in their reliability,
so we established in this study a new growth model to calculate the larval age
of \textit{Lucilia sericata} (Meigen 1826). This is based on the actual
non-linear development of the blow fly and is designed to include
uncertainties, e.g. for temperature values from the crime scene. We used
published data for the development of \textit{L. sericata} to estimate
non-linear functions describing the temperature dependent behavior of each
developmental state. For the new model it is most important to determine the
progress within one developmental state as correctly as possible since this
affects the accuracy of the PMI estimation by up to 75%. We found that PMI
calculations based on one mean temperature value differ by up to 65% from PMIs
based on an 12-hourly time temperature profile. Differences of 2\degree C in
the estimation of the crime scene temperature result in a deviation in PMI
calculation of 15 - 30%.

aging (ageing) is a complex interplay of genetic regulation and
damage-accumulation. "Aging as a result of accumulation of 'faults' on cellular
and molecular levels", has been proposed in the damage (fault)-accumulation
theory. However, this theory fails to explain some aging phenotypes such as
fibrosis and premature aging, since terms such as 'damage' and 'fault' are not
specified. Therefore we introduce some crucial modifications of this theory and
arrive at a novel theory: aging of the body is the result of accumulation of
Misrepair of tissue. It emphasizes: a) it is Misrepair, not the original
damage, that accumulates and leads to aging; and b) aging can occur at
different levels, however aging of the body takes place necessarily on the
tissue level, but not requiring the aging of cells/molecules. The
Misrepair-accumulation theory introduced in the present paper unifies the
understanding of the roles of environmental damage, repair, gene regulation,
and multicellular structure in the aging process. This theory gives
explanations for the aging phenotypes, premature aging, the difference of
longevity in different species, and it is consistent with the physical view on
complex systems.

covalent modification of signaling molecules, such as protein phosphorylation.
Under conditions of small molecule numbers, as is frequently the case in living
cells, mass action theory fails to describe the dynamics of such systems.
Instead, the biochemical reactions must be treated as stochastic processes that
intrinsically generate concentration fluctuations of the chemicals. We
investigate the stochastic reaction kinetics of covalent modification cycles
(CMCs) by analytical modeling and numerically exact Monte-Carlo simulation of
the temporally fluctuating concentration. Depending on the parameter regime, we
find for the probability density of the concentration qualitatively distinct
classes of distribution functions, including power law distributions with a
fractional and tunable exponent. These findings challenge the traditional view
of biochemical control networks as deterministic computational systems and
suggest that CMCs in cells can function as versatile and tunable noise
generators.

large proteins, is a complex dynamical process that involves the interplay of
ATP-consuming molecular motors, cytoskeleton filaments and the viscoelastic
cytoplasm. The displacements of particles or probes in the cell cytoplasm as a
function of time are characterized by different (anomalous) diffusion regimes.
We investigate here the motion of pigment organelles (melanosomes) driven by
myosin-V motors in \emph{Xenopus laevis} melanocytes using a high
spatio-temporal resolution tracking technique. By analyzing the mean square
displacement (MSD) of the obtained trajectories as a function of the time lag,
we show that the melanosomes display a transition between subdiffusive to
superdiffusive behavior. A stochastic theoretical model is introduced to
generalize the interpretation of our data. Starting from a generalized Langevin
equation that explicitly considers the collective action of the molecular
motors we derive an analytical expression for the MSD as a function of the time
lag, which also takes into account the experimental noise. By fitting our model
to the experimental data we were able to discriminate the exponents that
characterize the passive and active contributions to melanosome dynamics. The
model also estimates the "global" motor forces correctly. In this sense, our
model gives a quantitative description of active transport in living cells with
a reduced number of parameters.

adsorption onto biodevices as well as the undesirable effect of protein
fouling. The key to controlling protein-surface adsorptions is to identify and
quantify the main adsorption mechanisms: adsorptions that occur (1) while
depositing a protein solution onto dry surfaces and (2) after the deposition
onto wet surfaces. Bulk measurements cannot reveal the dynamic protein
adsorption pathways and thus cannot differentiate between the two adsorption
mechanisms. We imaged the interactions of single streptavidin molecules with
hydrophobic fused-silica surfaces in real-time. We observed both adsorbed
proteins on surfaces and diffusing proteins near surfaces and analyzed their
adsorption kinetics. Our analysis shows that the protein solution deposition
process is the primary mechanism of streptavidin adsorption onto surfaces at
the sub-nanomolar to nanomolar protein concentrations. Furthermore, we found
that hydrophilic fused-silica surfaces can prevent the adsorption of
streptavidin molecules.

generated by autoimmune reactions. The model is based on predator-prey
interactions between a host plants and their pathogens. Such interactions are
often frequency-dependent, so that pathogen attack is focused on the most
abundant plant phenotype, while rare plant types may escape pathogen attack.
Thus, frequency dependence can generate disruptive selection, which can give
rise to speciation if distant phenotypes become reproductively isolated. Based
on recent experimental evidence from {\it Arabidopsis}, we assume that at the
molecular level, incompatibility between strains is caused by epistatic
interactions between two proteins in the plant immune system, the guard and the
guardee. Within each plant strain, immune reactions occur when the guardee
protein is modified by a pathogen effector, and the guard subsequently binds to
the guardee, thus precipitating an immune response. However, when guard and
guardee proteins come from phenotypically distant parents, a hybrid's immune
system can be triggered by erroneous interactions between these proteins even
in the absence of pathogen attack, leading to severe autoimmune reactions in
hybrids. Our model shows how phenotypic variation generated by
frequency-dependent host-pathogen interactions can lead to postzygotic
incompatibility between extremal types, and hence to speciation.

population is proposed. This model is spatially explicit and features the
position of each individual together with another characteristic, such as the
size of the individual, which evolves according to a given stochastic model.
The population is locally regulated through an explicit competition kernel. The
IBM is represented as a measure-valued branching/diffusing stochastic process.
The approach allows (i) to describe the associated Monte Carlo simulation and
(ii) to analyze the limit process under large initial population size
asymptotic. The limit macroscopic model is a deterministic integro-differential
equation.

VWF multimers are regulated in size and reactivity for adhesion by
ADAMTS13-mediated proteolysis in a shear flow dependent manner. We examined if
tensile stress in VWF under shear flow activates the VWF A2 domain for cleavage
by ADAMTS13 using molecular dynamics simulations. We indeed observed stepwise
unfolding of A2 and exposure of its deeply buried ADAMTS13 cleavage site.
Interestingly, disulfide bonds in the adjacent and highly homologous VWF A1 and
A3 domains obstruct their mechanical unfolding. We generated a full length
mutant VWF featuring a homologous disulfide bond in A2 (N1493C and C1670S), in
an attempt to lock A2 against unfolding. We find this mutant to feature
ADAMTS13-resistant behavior in vitro. Our results yield molecular-detail
evidence for the force-sensoring function of VWF A2, by revealing how tension
in VWF due to shear flow selectively exposes the A2 proteolysis site to
ADAMTS13 for cleavage while keeping the folded remainder of A2 intact and
functional. We find the unconventional knotted Rossman fold of A2 to be the key
to this mechanical response, tailored for regulating VWF size and activity.
Based on our model we can explain the pathomechanism of some natural mutations
in the VWF A2 domain that significantly increase the cleavage by ADAMTS13
without shearing or chemical denaturation, and provide with the
cleavage-activated A2 conformation a structural basis for the design of
inhibitors for VWF type 2 diseases.

migration in a one-dimensional continuous population. The population is
described by a continuous limit of the stepping stone model, which leads to the
stochastic Fisher-Kolmogorov-Petrovsky-Piscounov equation with additional terms
describing mutations. Although the stepping stone model was first proposed for
population genetics, it is closely related to "voter models" of interest in
nonequilibrium statistical mechanics. The stepping stone model can also be
regarded as an approximation to the dynamics of a thin layer of actively
growing pioneers at the frontier of a colony of microorganisms undergoing a
range expansion on a Petri dish. We find that the population tends to segregate
into monoallelic domains. This segregation slows down genetic drift and
selection because these two evolutionary forces can only act at the boundaries
between the domains; the effects of mutation, however, are not significantly
affected by the segregation. Although fixation in the neutral well-mixed (or
"zero dimensional") model occurs exponentially in time, it occurs only
algebraically fast in the one-dimensional model. If selection is weak,
selective sweeps occur exponentially fast in both well-mixed and
one-dimensional populations, but the time constants are different. We also find
an unusual sublinear increase in the variance of the spatially averaged allele
frequency with time. Although we focus on two alleles or variants, q-allele
Potts-like models of gene segregation are considered as well. We also
investigate the effects of geometry at the frontier by considering growth of
circular colonies. Our analytical results are checked with simulations, and
could be tested against recent spatial experiments on range expansions off
linear inoculations of Escherichia coli and Saccharomyces cerevisiae.

  2010</comments><license>http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/</license><abstract>  We study the distribution of descendants of a known personality, or of
anybody else, as it propagates along generations from father or mother through
any of their children. We ask for the ratio of the descendants to the total
population and construct a model for the route of Distribution from Ancestors
to Descendants (DAD). The population ratio $r_n$ is found to be given by the
recursive equation $ r_{n+1} \approx (2-r_n) r_n ,$ that provides the
transition from the $n-$th to the $(n+1)$th generation. $ r_0 =1/N_0$ and $N_0$
is the total relevant population at the first generation. The number of
generations it takes to make half the population descendants is $\log N_0/\log
2$ and additional $\sim 4$ generations make everyone a descendent (=the full
descendant spreading time). These results are independent of the population
growth factor even if it changes along generations. As a running example we
consider the offspring of King David. Assuming a population between $N_0 =
10^6$ and $5 \cdot 10^6$ of Israelites at King David's time ($\sim 1000$ BC),
it took 24 to 26 generations (about 600-650 years, when taking 25 years for a
generation) to make every Israelite a King David descendent. The conclusion is
that practically every Israelite living today (and in fact already at 350-400
BC), and probably also many others beyond them, are descendants of King David.
We note that this work doesn't deal with any genetical aspect. We also didn't
take into account here any geo-social-demographic factor. Nevertheless, along
tens of generations, about 120 from King David's time till today, the DAD route
is likely to govern the distribution in communities that are not very isolated.

that shape the dynamics of large networks of spiking neurons. Previous work has
shown that such effective delays can be taken into account with a rate model
through the addition of an explicit, fixed delay [Roxin et al. PRL 238103
(2005)]. Here we extend this work to account for arbitrary symmetric patterns
of synaptic connectivity and generic nonlinear transfer functions.
Specifically, we conduct a weakly nonlinear analysis of the dynamical states
arising via primary instabilities of the asynchronous state. In this way we
determine analytically how the nature and stability of these states depend on
the choice of transfer function and connectivity. We arrive at two general
observations of physiological relevance that could not be explained in previous
works. These are: 1 - Fast oscillations are always supercritical for realistic
transfer functions. 2 - Traveling waves are preferred over standing waves given
plausible patterns of local connectivity. We finally demonstrate that these
results show a good agreement with those obtained performing numerical
simulations of a network of Hodgkin-Huxley neurons.

cases is often the only available information that one can obtain during early
stages of the outbreak. An important goal of early outbreak analysis is to
obtain a reliable estimate for the basic reproduction number, $R_{0}$, from the
limited information available. We present a novel method that enables us to
make a reliable real-time estimate of the reproduction number at a much earlier
stage compared to other available methods. Our method takes into account the
possibility that a disease has a wide distribution of infectious period and
that the degree distribution of the contact network is heterogeneous. We
validate our analytical framework with numerical simulations.

  RNA exhibits a variety of structural configurations. Here we consider a
structure to be tantamount to the noncrossing Watson-Crick and \pairGU-base
pairings (secondary structure) and additional cross-serial base pairs. These
interactions are called pseudoknots and are observed across the whole spectrum
of RNA functionalities. In the context of studying natural RNA structures,
searching for new ribozymes and designing artificial RNA, it is of interest to
find RNA sequences folding into a specific structure and to analyze their
induced neutral networks. Since the established inverse folding algorithms,
{\tt RNAinverse}, {\tt RNA-SSD} as well as {\tt INFO-RNA} are limited to RNA
secondary structures, we present in this paper the inverse folding algorithm
{\tt Inv} which can deal with 3-noncrossing, canonical pseudoknot structures.
  Results:
  In this paper we present the inverse folding algorithm {\tt Inv}. We give a
detailed analysis of {\tt Inv}, including pseudocodes. We show that {\tt Inv}
allows to design in particular 3-noncrossing nonplanar RNA pseudoknot
3-noncrossing RNA structures-a class which is difficult to construct via
dynamic programming routines. {\tt Inv} is freely available at
\url{http://www.combinatorics.cn/cbpc/inv.html}.
  Conclusions:
  The algorithm {\tt Inv} extends inverse folding capabilities to RNA
pseudoknot structures. In comparison with {\tt RNAinverse} it uses new ideas,
for instance by considering sets of competing structures. As a result, {\tt
Inv} is not only able to find novel sequences even for RNA secondary
structures, it does so in the context of competing structures that potentially
exhibit cross-serial interactions.

to conic-based surfaces (usually ellipse-based surfaces), obtaining their
characteristic radius of curvature and asphericity. Here we show that the
variation in radius and asphericity due to experimental noise is strongly
correlated. This correlation is seen both in experimental data of the corneal
topographer Pentacam and in simulations. We also show that the effect is a
characteristic of the geometry of ellipses, and not restricted to any
experimental device or fitting procedure.

reliable trajectory in state space. A reliable trajectory is defined as a
sequence of states which is independent of the order in which the nodes are
updated. We explored numerically the topology, the update functions, and the
state space structure of these networks, which we constructed using a minimum
number of links and the simplest update functions. We found that the clustering
coefficient is larger than in random networks, and that the probability
distribution of three-node motifs is similar to that found in gene regulation
networks. Among the update functions, only a subset of all possible functions
occur, and they can be classified according to their probability. More
homogeneous functions occur more often, leading to a dominance of canalyzing
functions. Finally, we studied the entire state space of the networks. We
observed that with increasing systems size, fixed points become more dominant,
moving the networks close to the frozen phase.

in the Fisher-Kolmogorov reaction-diffusion system. Our findings are in stark
contrast to the commonly used deterministic and weak-noise approximations. We
compute the wave velocity in one and two spatial dimensions, for which we find
a linear and a square-root dependence of the speed on the particle density.
Instead of smooth sigmoidal wave profiles, we observe fronts composed of a few
rugged kinks that diffuse, annihilate, and rarely branch; this dynamics leads
to power-law tails in the distribution of the front sizes.

in fields such as computational biology. As a proof of concept we use our
algorithm to align the similarity graphs of two interacting protein families
involved in bacterial signal transduction, and to predict actually interacting
protein partners between these families.

Escherichia coli play an important role in cell division. A number of different
models have been proposed to explain the dynamics from the underlying
biochemistry. Here, we extend a previously described discrete polymer model
from a deterministic to a stochastic formulation. We express the stochastic
evolution of the oscillatory system as a map from the probability distribution
of maximum polymer length in one period of the oscillation to the probability
distribution of maximum polymer length half a period later and solve for the
fixed point of the map with a combined analytical and numerical technique. This
solution gives a theoretical prediction of the distributions of both lengths of
the polar MinD zones and periods of oscillations -- both of which are
experimentally measurable. The model provides an interesting example of a
stochastic hybrid system that is, in some limits, analytically tractable.

biological objects. In this work we review our results on analysis and
optimization of single biochemical logic gates based on enzymatic reactions,
and a network of three gates, for reduction of the "analog" noise buildup. For
a single gate, optimization is achieved by analyzing the enzymatic reactions
within a framework of kinetic equations. We demonstrate that using
co-substrates with much smaller affinities than the primary substrate, a
negligible increase in the noise output from the logic gate is obtained as
compared to the input noise. A network of enzymatic gates is analyzed by
varying selective inputs and fitting standardized few-parameters response
functions assumed for each gate. This allows probing of the individual gate
quality but primarily yields information on the relative contribution of the
gates to noise amplification. The derived information is then used to modify
experimental single gate and network systems to operate them in a regime of
reduced analog noise amplification.

New

(i.e. mutation) rate is subcritical we get a phylogenetic tree consistent with
an influenza tree (few types at any given time and one dominating type lasting
a long time). When the birth rate is supercritical we get a phylogenetic tree
consistent with an HIV tree (many types at any given time, none lasting very
long).

of natural frequencies. Inspired by networks where there are two groups of
nodes with opposite behaviors, as for instance in power-grids where energy is
either generated or consumed at different locations, we assume that the
frequencies can take only two different values. Correlations between the value
of the frequency of a given node and its topological localization are
considered in both regular and random topologies. Synchronization is enhanced
when nodes are surrounded by nodes of the opposite frequency. We find
analytical estimations for the minimum value of the coupling strength between
oscillators that guarantees the achievement of a globally synchronized state,
getting a very good agreement with the numerical simulations.

analog noise generation by a single enzymatic logic gate can be dramatically
reduced to yield gate operation with virtually no input noise amplification.
This is achieved by exploiting the enzyme's specificity when using a
co-substrate that has a much lower affinity than the primary substrate. Under
these conditions, we obtain a negligible increase in the noise output from the
logic gate as compared to the input noise level. Experimental realizations of
the AND logic gate with the enzyme horseradish peroxidase using hydrogen
peroxide and two different co-substrates,
2,2'-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzthiazoline-6-sulphonic acid) (ABTS) and ferrocyanide,
with vastly different rate constants confirmed our general theoretical
conclusions.

development, progressively displacing neuronal cell bodies from each other. At
present, little is known about how cortical growth affects the development of
neuronal circuits. Here, in acute and chronic experiments, we study the layout
of ocular dominance (OD) columns in cat primary visual cortex (V1) during a
period of substantial postnatal growth. We find that despite a considerable
size increase of V1, the spacing between columns is largely preserved. In
contrast, their spatial arrangement changes systematically over this period.
While in young animals columns are more band-like, layouts become more
isotropic in mature animals. We propose a novel mechanism of growth-induced
reorganization that is based on the `zigzag instability', a dynamical
instability observed in several inanimate pattern forming systems. We argue
that this mechanism is inherent to a wide class of models for the
activity-dependent formation of OD columns. Analyzing one member of this class,
the Elastic Network model, we show that this mechanism can account for the
preservation of column spacing and the specific mode of reorganization of OD
columns that we observe. We conclude that neurons systematically shift their
selectivities during normal development and that this reorganization is induced
by the cortical expansion during growth. Our work suggests that cortical
circuits remain plastic for an extended period in development in order to
facilitate the modification of neuronal circuits to adjust for cortical growth.

results to corresponding ones for the canonical genetic code. We find that the

Our results render unlikely the notion that the doublet precursor was an
intermediate state in the evolution of the canonical genetic code. These
findings support the notion that code optimality reflects evolutionary
dynamics, and that if such a doublet code originally had a biochemical
significance, it arose before the emergence of translation.

face and possibly many other traits. This is because we possess the so-called
associative memory, that is the ability to correlate different memories to the
same fact or event. Associative memory is such a fundamental and encompassing
human ability (and not just human) that the network of neurons in our brain
must perform it quite easily. The question is then whether electronic neural
networks (electronic schemes that act somewhat similarly to human brains) can
be built to perform this type of function. Although the field of neural
networks has developed for many years, a key element, namely the synapses
between adjacent neurons, has been lacking a satisfactory electronic
representation. The reason for this is that a passive circuit element able to
reproduce the synapse behaviour needs to remember its past dynamical history,
store a continuous set of states, and be "plastic" according to the
pre-synaptic and post-synaptic neuronal activity. Here we show that all this
can be accomplished by a memory-resistor (memristor for short). In particular,
by using simple and inexpensive off-the-shelf components we have built a
memristor emulator which realizes all required synaptic properties. Most
importantly, we have demonstrated experimentally the formation of associative
memory in a simple neural network consisting of three electronic neurons
connected by two memristor-emulator synapses. This experimental demonstration
opens up new possibilities in the understanding of neural processes using
memory devices, an important step forward to reproduce complex learning,
adaptive and spontaneous behaviour with electronic neural networks.

biological pathways along which they lie. Inference of activated gene pathways,
using gene expression data during disease progression, is an important problem.
In this work, we have developed a generalizable framework for the
identification of interacting pathways while incorporating biological realism,
using functional data analysis and manifold embedding techniques. Additionally,
we have also developed a new method to query for the differential co-ordinated
activity of any desired pathway during disease progression. The methods
developed in this work can be generalized to any conditions of interest.

recombining with a probability $r$ in a two locus model. Starting from a low
fitness locus, the population is evolved under mutation, selection and
recombination until a finite fraction of the population reaches the fittest
locus. An analytical method is developed to calculate the fixation time $T$ to
the fittest locus for various choices of epistasis. We find that (1) for
negative epistasis, $T$ decreases slowly for small $r$ but decays fast at
larger $r$ (2) for positive epistasis, $T$ increases linearly for small $r$ and
mildly for large $r$ (3) for compensatory mutation, $T$ diverges as a power law
with logarithmic corrections as the recombination fraction approaches a
critical value. Our calculations are seen to be in good agreement with the
exact numerical results.

plant cells. It consists of a more or less homogeneously distributed array of
highly aligned microtubules connected to the inner side of the plasma membrane
and oriented transversely to the cell growth axis. Here we formulate a
continuum model to describe the origin of orientational order in such confined
arrays of dynamical microtubules. The model is based on recent experimental
observations that show that a growing cortical microtubule can interact through
angle dependent collisions with pre-existing microtubules that can lead either
to co-alignment of the growth, retraction through catastrophe induction or
crossing over the encountered microtubule. We identify a single control
parameter, which is fully determined by the nucleation rate and intrinsic
dynamics of individual microtubules. We solve the model analytically in the
stationary isotropic phase, discuss the limits of stability of this isotropic
phase, and explicitly solve for the ordered stationary states in a simplified
version of the model.

protein interactions network. Two distinct sources contribute to the noise in
such a system: intrinsic noise, inherent in the studied reactions, and
extrinsic noise generated in other parts of the network or in the environment.
We study the effect of extrinsic noise entering the system through a nonlinear
uptake reaction which acts as a nonlinear filter. Varying input noise intensity
varies the mean of the noise after the passage through the filter, which
changes the stability properties of the system. The steady-state displacement
due to small noise is independent on the kinetics of the system but it only
depends on the nonlinearity of the input function.
  For monotonically increasing and concave input functions such as the
Michaelis-Menten uptake rate, we give a simple argument based on the
small-noise expansion, which enables qualitative predictions of the
steady-state displacement only by inspection of experimental data: when weak
and rapid noise enters the system through a Michaelis-Menten reaction, then the
graph of the system's steady states vs. the mean of the input signal always
shifts to the right as noise intensity increases.
  We test the predictions on two models of lac operon, where TMG/lactose uptake
is driven by a Michaelis-Menten enzymatic process. We show that as a
consequence of the steady state displacement due to fluctuations in
extracellular TMG/lactose concentration the lac switch responds in an
asymmetric manner: as noise intensity increases, switching off lactose
metabolism becomes easier and switching it on becomes more difficult.

may constrain mammalian brain evolution, architecture, and function. This
article investigates physical limits on brain wiring and corresponding changes
in brain temperature that are imposed by thermodynamics of heat balance
determined mainly by Na$^{+}$/K$^{+}$-ATPase, cerebral blood flow, and heat
conduction. It is found that even moderate firing rates cause significant
intracellular Na$^{+}$ build-up, and the ATP consumption rate associated with
pumping out these ions grows nonlinearly with frequency. Surprisingly, the
power dissipated by the Na$^{+}$/K$^{+}$ pump depends biphasically on
frequency, which can lead to the biphasic dependence of brain temperature on
frequency as well. Both the total power of sodium pumps and brain temperature
diverge for very small fiber diameters, indicating that too thin fibers are not
beneficial for thermal balance. For very small brains blood flow is not a
sufficient cooling mechanism deep in the brain. The theoretical lower bound on
fiber diameter above which brain temperature is in the operational regime is
strongly frequency dependent but finite due to synaptic depression. For normal
neurophysiological conditions this bound is at least an order of magnitude
smaller than average values of empirical fiber diameters, suggesting that
neuroanatomy of the mammalian brains operates in the thermodynamically safe
regime. Analytical formulas presented can be used to estimate average firing
rates in mammals, and relate their changes to changes in brain temperature,
which can have important practical applications. In general, activity in larger
brains is found to be slower than in smaller brains.

probably arises via preferential attachment of some sort. However, the origin
of various other topological features, such as degree-degree correlations and
related characteristics, is often not clear and attributed to specific
functional requirements. We show how it is possible to analyse a very general
scenario in which nodes gain or lose edges according to any (e.g., nonlinear)
functions of local and/or global degree information. Applying our method to two
rather different examples of brain development -- synaptic pruning in humans
and the neural network of the worm C. Elegans -- we find that simple
biologically motivated assumptions lead to very good agreement with
experimental data. In particular, many nontrivial topological features of the
worm's brain arise naturally at a critical point.

cellular level of neurons, as a result of their mutual interactions, leads to
the observed behavior of an organism responding to a variety of environmental
stimuli. Investigating the intermediate or mesoscopic level of organization in
the nervous system is a vital step towards understanding how the integration of
micro-level dynamics results in macro-level functioning. In this paper, we have
considered the somatic nervous system of the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans,
for which the entire neuronal connectivity diagram is known. We focus on the
organization of the system into modules, i.e., neuronal groups having
relatively higher connection density compared to that of the overall network.
We show that this mesoscopic feature cannot be explained exclusively in terms
of considerations, such as optimizing for resource constraints (viz., total
wiring cost) and communication efficiency (i.e., network path length).
Comparison with other complex networks designed for efficient transport (of
signals or resources) implies that neuronal networks form a distinct class.
This suggests that the principal function of the network, viz., processing of
sensory information resulting in appropriate motor response, may be playing a
vital role in determining the connection topology. Using modular spectral
analysis, we make explicit the intimate relation between function and structure
in the nervous system. This is further brought out by identifying functionally
critical neurons purely on the basis of patterns of intra- and inter-modular
connections. Our study reveals how the design of the nervous system reflects
several constraints, including its key functional role as a processor of
information.

proteins, analyzing the structure of protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks
could explain complex biological mechanisms, evolution, and disease. Similarly,
studying protein structure networks, residue interaction graphs (RIGs), might
provide insights into protein folding, stability, and function. The first step
towards understanding these networks is finding an adequate network model that
closely replicates their structure. Evaluating the fit of a model to the data
requires comparing the model with real-world networks. Since network
comparisons are computationally infeasible, they rely on heuristics, or
"network properties." We show that it is difficult to assess the reliability of
the fit of a model with any individual network property. Thus, our approach
integrates a variety of network properties and further combines these with a
series of probabilistic methods to predict an appropriate network model for
biological networks. We find geometric random graphs, that model spatial
relationships between objects, to be the best-fitting model for RIGs. This
validates the correctness of our method, since RIGs have previously been shown
to be geometric. We apply our approach to noisy PPI networks and demonstrate
that their structure is also consistent with geometric random graphs.

understanding of complex systems. One of the most relevant features of graphs
representing real systems is community structure, or clustering, i. e. the
organization of vertices in clusters, with many edges joining vertices of the
same cluster and comparatively few edges joining vertices of different
clusters. Such clusters, or communities, can be considered as fairly
independent compartments of a graph, playing a similar role like, e. g., the
tissues or the organs in the human body. Detecting communities is of great
importance in sociology, biology and computer science, disciplines where
systems are often represented as graphs. This problem is very hard and not yet
satisfactorily solved, despite the huge effort of a large interdisciplinary
community of scientists working on it over the past few years. We will attempt
a thorough exposition of the topic, from the definition of the main elements of
the problem, to the presentation of most methods developed, with a special
focus on techniques designed by statistical physicists, from the discussion of
crucial issues like the significance of clustering and how methods should be
tested and compared against each other, to the description of applications to
real networks.

  models for neuroscience</title><categories>q-bio.NC</categories><comments>4 pages, 4 figures, ICASSP 2010</comments><license>http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/</license><abstract>  Sparse coding networks, which utilize unsupervised learning to maximize
coding efficiency, have successfully reproduced response properties found in
primary visual cortex \cite{AN:OlshausenField96}. However, conventional sparse
coding models require that the coding circuit can fully sample the sensory data
in a one-to-one fashion, a requirement not supported by experimental data from
the thalamo-cortical projection. To relieve these strict wiring requirements,
we propose a sparse coding network constructed by introducing synaptic learning
in the framework of compressed sensing. We demonstrate that the new model
evolves biologically realistic spatially smooth receptive fields despite the
fact that the feedforward connectivity subsamples the input and thus the
learning has to rely on an impoverished and distorted account of the original
visual data. Further, we demonstrate that the model could form a general scheme
of cortical communication: it can form meaningful representations in a
secondary sensory area, which receives input from the primary sensory area
through a "compressing" cortico-cortical projection. Finally, we prove that our
model belongs to a new class of sparse coding algorithms in which recurrent
connections are essential in forming the spatial receptive fields.

graphs arising from a set of initial states $S\subseteq\Z^n_+$ and a set of
transitions/reactions $M\subseteq\Z^n_+\times\Z^n_+$. The clusters are formed
out of states that can be mutually transformed into each other by a sequence of
reversible transitions. We provide a solution method from computational
commutative algebra that allows for deciding whether two given states belong to
the same cluster as well as for the reconstruction of the full cluster graph.
Using the cluster graph approach we provide solutions to two fundamental
questions: 1) Deciding whether two states are connected, e.g., if the initial
state can be turned into the final state by a sequence of transition and 2)
listing concisely all reactions processes that can accomplish that. As a
computational example, we apply the framework to the permanganate/oxalic acid
reaction.

diplodiploid host species by the bacterial endosymbiont \textit{Wolbachia}. The
continuous models are characterized by partial vertical transmission,
cytoplasmic incompatibility and fitness costs associated with the infection. A
particular aspect of interest is competitions between mutually incompatible
strains. We further introduce an age-structured model that takes into account
different fertility and mortality rates at different stages of the life cycle
of the individuals. With only a few parameters, the ordinary differential
equation models exhibit already interesting dynamics and can be used to predict
criteria under which a strain of bacteria is able to invade a population.
Interestingly, but not surprisingly, the age-structured model shows significant
differences concerning the existence and stability of equilibrium solutions
compared to the unstructured model.

dynamical system. Here, we consider a particular case of recombination in {\em
discrete} time, allowing only for {\em single crossovers}. While the analogous
dynamics in {\em continuous} time admits a closed solution, this no longer
works for discrete time. A more general model (i.e. without the restriction to
single crossovers) has been studied before and was solved algorithmically by
means of Haldane linearisation. Using the special formalism introduced by Baake
and Baake (2003), we obtain further insight into the single-crossover dynamics
and the particular difficulties that arise in discrete time. We then transform
the equations to a solvable system in a two-step procedure: linearisation
followed by diagonalisation. Still, the coefficients of the second step must be
determined in a recursive manner, but once this is done for a given system,
they allow for an explicit solution valid for all times.

order nonlinear partial differential equation equipped with a nonlocal boundary
condition, with a constant external inflow of individuals. We prove that the
linearised system is governed by a quasicontraction semigroup. We also
establish that linear stability of equilibrium solutions is governed by a
generalized net reproduction function. In a special case of the model
ingredients we discuss the nonlinear dynamics of the system when the spectral
bound of the linearised operator equals zero, i.e. when linearisation does not
decide stability. This allows us to demonstrate, through a concrete example,
how immigration might be beneficial to the population. In particular, we show
that from a nonlinearly unstable positive equilibrium a linearly stable and
unstable pair of equilibria bifurcates. In fact, the linearised system exhibits
bistability, for a certain range of values of the external inflow, induced
potentially by All\'{e}e-effect.

copy number variation (CNV). Fortunately, modern genotyping platforms also
detect CNVs with fairly high reliability. Hidden Markov models and algorithms
have played a dominant role in the interpretation of CNV data. Here we explore
CNV reconstruction via estimation with a fused-lasso penalty as suggested by
Tibshirani and Wang [Biostatistics 9 (2008) 18--29]. We mount a fresh attack on
this difficult optimization problem by the following: (a) changing the penalty
terms slightly by substituting a smooth approximation to the absolute value
function, (b) designing and implementing a new MM (majorization--minimization)
algorithm, and (c) applying a fast version of Newton's method to jointly update
all model parameters. Together these changes enable us to minimize the
fused-lasso criterion in a highly effective way. We also reframe the
reconstruction problem in terms of imputation via discrete optimization. This
approach is easier and more accurate than parameter estimation because it
relies on the fact that only a handful of possible copy number states exist at
each SNP. The dynamic programming framework has the added bonus of exploiting
information that the current fused-lasso approach ignores. The accuracy of our
imputations is comparable to that of hidden Markov models at a substantially
lower computational cost.

navigability of animals in weak magnetic fields, enabling e.g. birds to see the
Earth's magnetic field. It also plays an essential role in the field of spin
chemistry. Here, we show how quantum control can be used to either enhance or
reduce the performance of such a chemical compass, providing a new route to
further study the radical pair mechanism and its applications. We study the
role of quantum entanglement in this mechanism, and demonstrate intriguing
connections between radical-pair entanglement and the magnetic field
sensitivity of the compass. Beyond their immediate application to the radical
pair mechanism, these results also demonstrate how state-of-the-art quantum
technologies could potentially be used to probe and control biological
functions.

speed from terrestrial climate correlations. We test these fits against new
data on spiral structure based on CO data that does not make simplifying
assumptions about symmetry and circular rotation. If we compare the times of
these transits to changes in the climate of Earth, not only do the claimed
correlations disappear, but also we find that they cannot be resurrected for
any reasonable pattern speed.

collisions between the membrane-bound cortical microtubules, suggesting a
possible mechanism for their alignment. We present both a coarse-grained
theoretical model and stochastic particle-based simulations of this mechanism,
and compare the results from these complementary approaches. Our results
indicate that collisions that induce depolymerization are sufficient to
generate the alignment of microtubules in the cortical array.

toward other neurons' dendrites, the effect on each of those neurons is
mediated by the weight of the synapse that separates it from the firing neuron.
This weight, in turn, is affected by the postsynaptic neuron's response through
a mechanism that is thought to underlie important processes such as learning
and memory. Although of difficult quantification, cortical synaptic weights
have been found to obey a long-tailed unimodal distribution peaking near the
lowest values, thus confirming some of the predictive models built previously.
These models are all causally local, in the sense that they refer to the
situation in which a number of neurons all fire directly at the same
postsynaptic neuron. Consequently, they necessarily embody assumptions
regarding the generation of action potentials by the presynaptic neurons that
have little biological interpretability. In this letter we introduce a network
model of large groups of interconnected neurons and demonstrate, making none of
the assumptions that characterize the causally local models, that its long-term
behavior gives rise to a distribution of synaptic weights with the same
properties that were experimentally observed. In our model the action
potentials that create a neuron's input are, ultimately, the product of
network-wide causal chains relating what happens at a neuron to the firings of
others. Our model is then of a causally global nature and predicates the
emergence of the synaptic-weight distribution on network structure and
function. As such, it has the potential to become instrumental also in the
study of other emergent cortical phenomena.

shows that excluded volume caused by finite thickness induces an anisotropic
increase of the main axes of the conformations, a change of shape, accomplished
by an enhanced correlation along the contour.

The network
evolves as result of the activities of the neurons following
spike-timing-dependent plasticity rules. We apply a self-consistent mean-field
theory to the system to obtain the mean activity level for the system as a
function of the mean synaptic weight, which predicts a first-order transition
and hysteresis between a noise-dominated regime and a regime of persistent
neural activity. Assuming Poisson firing statistics for the neurons, the
plasticity dynamics of a synapse under the influence of the mean-field
environment can be mapped to the dynamics of an asymmetric random walk in
synaptic-weight space. Using a master-equation for small steps, we predict a
narrow distribution of synaptic weights that scales with the square root of the
plasticity rate for the stationary state of the system given plausible
physiological parameter values describing neural transmission and plasticity.
The dependence of the distribution on the synaptic weight of the mean-field
environment allows us to determine the mean synaptic weight self-consistently.
The effect of fluctuations in the total synaptic conductance and plasticity
step sizes are also considered. Such fluctuations result in a smoothing of the
first-order transition for low number of afferent synapses per neuron and a
broadening of the synaptic weight distribution, respectively.

evolution of replicators with a high level of abstraction. In this paper we
apply novel methods of analysis of selection systems to the replicator
equations. To be suitable for the suggested algorithm the interaction matrix of
the replicator equation should be transformed; in particular the standard
singular value decomposition allows us to rewrite the replicator equation in a
convenient form. The original $n$-dimensional problem is reduced to the
analysis of asymptotic behavior of the solutions to the so-called escort
system, which in some important cases can be of significantly smaller dimension
than the original system. The Newton diagram methods are applied to study the
asymptotic behavior of the solutions to the escort system, when interaction
matrix has rank 1 or 2. A general replicator equation with the interaction
matrix of rank 1 is fully analyzed; the conditions are provided when the
asymptotic state is a polymorphic equilibrium. As an example of the system with
the interaction matrix of rank 2 we consider the problem from [Adams, M.R. and
Sornborger, A.T., J Math Biol, 54:357-384, 2007], for which we show, for
arbitrary dimension of the system and under some suitable conditions, that
generically one globally stable equilibrium exits on the 1-skeleton of the
simplex.

on the mathematical theory of deformable porous media. Tumor is modeled as a
saturated mixture of proliferating cells, extracellular fluid and extracellular
matrix, that occupies a spatial region close to a blood vessel whence cells get
the nutrient needed for their vital functions. Growth of tumor cells takes
place within a healthy host tissue, which is in turn modeled as a saturated
mixture of non-proliferating cells. Interactions between these two regions are
accounted for as an essential mechanism for the growth of the tumor mass. By
weakening the role of the extracellular matrix, which is regarded as a rigid
non-remodeling scaffold, a system of two partial differential equations is
derived, describing the evolution of the cell volume ratio coupled to the
dynamics of the nutrient, whose higher and lower concentration levels determine
proliferation or death of tumor cells, respectively. Numerical simulations of a
reference two-dimensional problem are shown and commented, and a qualitative
mathematical analysis of some of its key issues is proposed.

survival in a hostile environment. However, from a thermodynamic perspective,
life is a dynamic, out of equilibrium process, stabilizing and coevolving in
concert with its abiotic environment. The living component of the biosphere of
greatest mass, the plants and cyanobacteria, are involved in the transpiration
of vast amounts of water. Transpiration is part of the global water cycle, and
it is this cycle that distinguishes Earth from its apparently life barren
neighboring planets, Venus and Mars. The water cycle, including the absorption
of sunlight in the biosphere, is by far the greatest entropy producing process
occurring on Earth. Life, from this perspective, can therefore be viewed as
performing an important thermodynamic function; acting as a dynamic catalyst by
aiding process such as the water cycle, hurricanes, and ocean and wind currents
to produce entropy. The role of animals in this view is that of unwitting but
dedicated servants of the plants and cyanobacteria, helping them to grow and to
spread into initially inhospitable areas.

origin. Life, as are all irreversible processes, is contingent on entropy
production. Entropy production is a measure of the rate of the tendency of
Nature to explore available microstates. The most important irreversible
process generating entropy in the biosphere, and thus facilitating this
exploration, is the absorption and transformation of sunlight into heat. Here
we hypothesize that life began, and persists today, as a catalyst for the
absorption and dissipation of sunlight at the surface of shallow seas. The
resulting heat is then efficiently harvested by other irreversible processes
such as the water cycle, hurricanes, and ocean and wind currents. RNA and DNA
are the most efficient of all known molecules for absorbing the intense
ultraviolet light that could have penetrated the dense early atmosphere, and
are remarkably rapid in transforming this light into heat in the presence of
liquid water. From this perspective, the origin and evolution of life,
inseparable from water and the water cycle, can be understood as resulting from
the natural thermodynamic imperative of increasing the entropy production of
the Earth in its interaction with its solar environment. A mechanism is
proposed for the reproduction of RNA and DNA without the need for enzymes,
promoted instead through UV light dissipation and the ambient conditions of
prebiotic Earth.

two different models in population dynamics, the
susceptible-infective-recovered-susceptible model of infection spread and a
predator-prey interaction model, on a network of homogeneous degree $k$. These
models have similar phase diagrams and represent two classes of systems for
which noisy oscillations, still largely unexplained, are observed in nature. We
show that for a certain range of the parameter $k$ both models exhibit an
oscillatory phase in a region of parameter space that corresponds to weak
driving. This oscillatory phase, however, disappears when $k$ is large. For
$k=3, 4$, we compare the phase diagram of the standard pair approximation
equations of both models with the results of simulations on regular random
graphs of the same degree. We show that for parameter values in the oscillatory
phase, and even for large system sizes, the simulations either die out or
exhibit damped oscillations, depending on the initial conditions. We discuss
this failure of the standard pair approximation model to capture even the
qualitative behavior of the simulations on large regular random graphs and the
relevance of the oscillatory phase in the pair approximation diagrams to
explain the cycling behavior found in real populations.

Appl. Probab. 50 (2013) 239-255</journal-ref><license>http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/</license><abstract>  Gene conversion is a mechanism by which a double-strand break in a DNA
molecule is repaired using a homologous DNA molecule as a template. As a
result, one gene is 'copied and pasted' onto the other gene. It was recently
reported that the direction of gene conversion appears to be biased towards G
and C nucleotides. In this paper a stochastic model of the dynamics of the bias
in gene conversion is developed for a finite population of members in a
multigene family. The dual process is the biased voter model, which generates
an ancestral random graph for a given sample. An importance-sampling algorithm
for computing the likelihood of the sample is also given.

system grow and develop via a number of different mechanisms, such as the
addition and deletion of nodes, the addition and deletion of edges, as well as
the duplication or fusion of nodes. While each of these mechanisms can have a
different cause depending on whether the network is biological, technological,
or social, their impact on the network's structure, as well as its local and
global properties, is similar. This allows us to study how each of these
mechanisms affects networks either alone or together with the other processes,
and how they shape the characteristics that have been observed. We study how a
network's growth parameters impact the distribution of edges in the network,
how they affect a network's modularity, and point out that some parameters will
give rise to networks that have the opposite tendency, namely to display
anti-modularity. Within the model we are describing, we can search the space of
possible networks for parameter sets that generate networks that are very
similar to well-known and well-studied examples, such as the brain of a worm,
and the network of interactions of the proteins in baker's yeast.

resource (limiting factor). This concept was originally applied to plant or
crop growth (Justus von Liebig, 1840) and quantitatively supported by many
experiments. Some generalizations based on more complicated "dose-response"
curves were proposed. Violations of this law in natural and experimental
ecosystems were also reported. We study models of adaptation in ensembles of
similar organisms under load of environmental factors and prove that violation
of Liebig's law follows from adaptation effects. If the fitness of an organism
in fixed environment satisfies the law of the minimum then adaptation equalizes
the pressure of essential factors and therefore acts against the Liebig's law.
This is the the Law of the Minimum paradox: if for a randomly chosen pair
"organism--environment" the Law of the Minimum typically holds, then, in a
well-adapted system, we have to expect violations of this law. For the opposite
interaction of factors (a synergistic system of factors which amplify each
other) adaptation leads from factor equivalence to limitations by a smaller
number of factors.
  For analysis of adaptation we develop a system of models based on Selye's
idea of the universal adaptation resource (adaptation energy). These models
predict that under the load of an environmental factor a population separates
into two groups (phases): a less correlated, well adapted group and a highly
correlated group with a larger variance of attributes, which experiences
problems with adaptation. Some empirical data are presented and evidences of
interdisciplinary applications to econometrics are discussed.

with the presence of the single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) at the -308
position of the tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-$\alpha$) gene. We also
consider the influence of the occurrence of type 2 diabetes (t2DM). Using
Bayesian inference, we first pursue a bottom-up approach to compute the working
hypothesis and the probabilities derivable from the data. We then pursue a
top-down approach by modelling the signal pathway that causally connects the
SNP with the emergence of CHD. We compute the functional form of the
probability of CHD conditional on the presence of the SNP in terms of both the
statistical and biochemical properties of the system. From the probability of
occurrence of a disease conditional on a given risk factor, we explore the
possibility of extracting information on the pathways involved in the
occurrence of the disease. This is a first study that we want to systematise
into a comprehensive formalism to be applied to the inference of the mechanism
connecting the risk factors to the disease.

repertoire is selected in the thymus. We map thymic selection processes to an
extreme value problem and provide an analytic expression for the amino acid
compositions of selected TCRs (which enable its recognition functions).

homological relationships in large molecular databases. It can be mapped on the
physical model of directed polymers in random media. We consider the
finite-temperature version of local sequence alignment for proteins and study
the transition between the linear phase and the biologically relevant
logarithmic phase, where the free-energy grows linearly or logarithmically with
the sequence length. By means of numerical simulations and finite-size scaling
analysis we determine the phase diagram in the plane that is spanned by the gap
costs and the temperature. We use the most frequently used parameter set for
protein alignment. The critical exponents that describe the parameter driven
transition are found to be explicitly temperature dependent.
  Furthermore, we study the shape of the (free-) energy distribution close to
the transition by rare-event simulations down to probabilities of the order
$10^{-64}$. It is well known that, in the logarithmic region, the optimal score
distribution (T=0) is described by a modified Gumbel distribution. We confirm
that this also applies for the free-energy distribution ($T&gt;0$). However, in
the linear phase, the distribution crosses over to a modified Gaussian
distribution.

diagrams on the level of individual synapses remain scarce and the insights
into function they can provide remain unclear. Even for Caenorhabditis elegans,
whose neuronal network is relatively small and stereotypical from animal to
animal, published wiring diagrams are neither accurate nor complete and
self-consistent. Using materials from White et al. and new electron micrographs
we assemble whole, self-consistent gap junction and chemical synapse networks
of hermaphrodite C. elegans. We propose a method to visualize the wiring
diagram, which reflects network signal flow. We calculate statistical and
topological properties of the network, such as degree distributions, synaptic
multiplicities, and small-world properties, that help in understanding network
signal propagation. We identify neurons that may play central roles in
information processing and network motifs that could serve as functional
modules of the network. We explore propagation of neuronal activity in response
to sensory or artificial stimulation using linear systems theory and find
several activity patterns that could serve as substrates of previously
described behaviors. Finally, we analyze the interaction between the gap
junction and the chemical synapse networks. Since several statistical
properties of the C. elegans network, such as multiplicity and motif
distributions are similar to those found in mammalian neocortex, they likely
point to general principles of neuronal networks. The wiring diagram reported
here can help in understanding the mechanistic basis of behavior by generating
predictions about future experiments involving genetic perturbations, laser
ablations, or monitoring propagation of neuronal activity in response to
stimulation.

providing new functions or already existing functions at a simpler process
level and at a lower cost by virtue of their self-organization capabilities.
Moreover, they are not bound to von Neuman architecture and this feature may
open the way to other architectural paradigms. Neuromorphic electronics is one
of them. Here we demonstrate a device made of molecules and nanoparticles, a
nanoparticle organic memory filed-effect transistor (NOMFET), which exhibits
the main behavior of a biological spiking synapse. Facilitating and depressing
synaptic behaviors can be reproduced by the NOMFET and can be programmed. The
synaptic plasticity for real time computing is evidenced and described by a
simple model. These results open the way to rate coding utilization of the
NOMFET in dynamical neuromorphic computing circuits.

population of bacteria is distributed over all individuals that belong to the
specific taxon. It implies that certain genes can be gained and lost from
generation to generation. We use the random genealogy given by a Kingman
coalescent in order to superimpose events of gene gain and loss along ancestral
lines. Gene gains occur at a constant rate along ancestral lines. We assume
that gained genes have never been present in the population before. Gene losses
occur at a rate proportional to the number of genes present along the ancestral
line. In this infinitely many genes model we derive moments for several
statistics within a sample: the average number of genes per individual, the
average number of genes differing between individuals, the number of
incongruent pairs of genes, the total number of different genes in the sample
and the gene frequency spectrum. We demonstrate that the model gives a
reasonable fit with gene frequency data from marine cyanobacteria.

target site on a semiflexible polymer, a key factor determining the kinetics of
DNA-protein binding and polymerization of cytoskeletal filaments. Our theory
focuses on two competing effects: polymer shape fluctuations, which speed up
association, and the hydrodynamic coupling between the diffusing particle and
the chain, which slows down association. Polymer bending fluctuations are
described using a mean field dynamical theory, while the hydrodynamic coupling
between polymer and particle is incorporated through a simple heuristic
approximation. Both of these we validate through comparison with Brownian
dynamics simulations. Neither of the effects has been fully considered before
in the biophysical context, and we show they are necessary to form accurate
estimates of reaction processes. The association rate depends on the stiffness
of the polymer and the particle size, exhibiting a maximum for intermediate
persistence length and a minimum for intermediate particle radius. In the
parameter range relevant to DNA-protein binding, the rate increase is up to
100% compared to the Smoluchowski result for simple center-of-mass motion. The
quantitative predictions made by the theory can be tested experimentally.

of multi-dimensional classical systems, in contact with a heat-bath. When the
potential energy landscape is rugged, the kinetics displays a decoupling of
short and long time scales and both
  Molecular Dynamics (MD) or Monte Carlo (MC) simulations are generally
inefficient. Using a field theoretic approach, we perform analytically the
average over the short-time stochastic fluctuations. This way, we obtain an
effective theory, which generates the same long-time dynamics of the original
theory, but has a lower time resolution power. Such an approach is used to
develop an improved version of the MC algorithm, which is particularly suitable
to investigate the dynamics of rare conformational transitions. In the specific
case of molecular systems at room temperature, we show that elementary
integration time steps used to simulate the effective theory can be chosen a
factor ~100 larger than those used in the original theory. Our results are
illustrated and tested on a simple system, characterized by a rugged energy
landscape.

modeling of infectious diseases, human mobility represents a crucial challenge
both on the theoretical side and in view of the limited availability of
empirical data. In order to study the interplay between small-scale commuting
flows and long-range airline traffic in shaping the spatio-temporal pattern of
a global epidemic we i) analyze mobility data from 29 countries around the
world and find a gravity model able to provide a global description of
commuting patterns up to 300 kms; ii) integrate in a worldwide structured
metapopulation epidemic model a time-scale separation technique for evaluating
the force of infection due to multiscale mobility processes in the disease
dynamics. Commuting flows are found, on average, to be one order of magnitude
larger than airline flows. However, their introduction into the worldwide model
shows that the large scale pattern of the simulated epidemic exhibits only
small variations with respect to the baseline case where only airline traffic
is considered. The presence of short range mobility increases however the
synchronization of subpopulations in close proximity and affects the epidemic
behavior at the periphery of the airline transportation infrastructure. The
present approach outlines the possibility for the definition of layered
computational approaches where different modeling assumptions and granularities
can be used consistently in a unifying multi-scale framework.

in time, but the underlying mechanisms are usually uncertain. They may include
seasonal changes in the environment, contact rate, immune system response, etc.
The transmission rate has been thought difficult to measure directly. We
present a new algorithm to compute the time-dependent transmission rate
directly from prevalence data, which makes no assumptions about the number of
susceptibles or vital rates. The algorithm follows our complete and explicit
solution of a mathematical inverse problem for SIR-type transmission models. We
prove that almost any infection profile can be perfectly fitted by an SIR model
with variable transmission rate. This clearly shows a serious danger of
over-fitting such transmission models. We illustrate the algorithm with
historic UK measles data and our observations support the common belief that
measles transmission was predominantly driven by school contacts.

and social systems modeled in terms of complex weighted networks. Here, we
introduce a general formalism that allows to easily write down mean-field
equations for any diffusive dynamics on weighted networks. We also propose the
concept of annealed weighted networks, in which such equations become exact. We
show the validity of our approach addressing the problem of the random walk
process, pointing out a strong departure of the behavior observed in quenched
real scale-free networks from the mean-field predictions. Additionally, we show
how to employ our formalism for more complex dynamics. Our work sheds light on
mean-field theory on weighted networks and on its range of validity, and warns
about the reliability of mean-field results for complex dynamics.

mechanical properties of adherent cells in the physiologically relevant regime
of large forces. We used magnetic tweezers to apply forces to magnetic beads
bound to the cytoskeleton, and recorded the resulting deformation (creep
response). The creep response followed a weak power law at all force levels.
Stress stiffening and fluidization occurred simultaneously and were quantified
by the force-dependence of the creep compliance and the power law exponent. The
amount of stiffening and fluidization in response to force was controlled
solely by the contractile prestress of the cell and followed a simple
relationship. This behavior may be of fundamental importance in biological
processes that involve a mechanical interaction between cells and their
environment.

in a particular network than in an ensemble of randomized networks--has become
a ubiquitous method for uncovering potentially important subunits within
networks drawn from a wide variety of fields. We find that the most common
algorithms used to generate the ensemble from the real network change subgraph
counts in a highly correlated manner, so that one subgraph's status as a motif
may not be independent from the statuses of the other subgraphs. We demonstrate
this effect for the problem of 3- and 4-node motif identification in the
transcriptional regulatory networks of E. coli and S. cerevisiae in which
randomized networks are generated via an edge-swapping algorithm (Milo et al.,
Science 298:824, 2002). We show that correlations among 3-node subgraphs are
easily interpreted, and we present an information-theoretic tool that may be
used to identify correlations among subgraphs of any size.

with prior information about the clusters. Specifically, we assume that for a
fraction $\rho$ of the nodes their true cluster assignments are known in
advance. This can be understood as a semi--supervised version of clustering, in
contrast to unsupervised clustering where the only available information is the
graph structure. In the unsupervised case, it is known that there is a
threshold of the inter--cluster connectivity beyond which clusters cannot be
detected. Here we study the impact of the prior information on the detection
threshold, and show that even minute [but generic] values of $\rho&gt;0$ shift the
threshold downwards to its lowest possible value. For weighted graphs we show
that a small semi--supervising can be used for a non-trivial definition of
communities.

self-assembly, using the Platonic solids as target structures. We find marked
differences between the assembly behaviours of the different systems.
Tetrahedra, octahedra and icosahedra assemble easily, while cubes are more
challenging and dodecahedra do not assemble. We relate these differences to the
kinetics and thermodynamics of assembly, with the formation of large disordered
aggregates a particular important competitor to correct assembly. In
particular, the free energy landscapes of those targets that are easy to
assemble are funnel-like, whereas for the dodecahedral system the landscape is
relatively flat with little driving force to facilitate escape from disordered
aggregates.

interactions that can be considered as a minimal model for the assembly of
viral capsids and other shell-like protein complexes. We thoroughly explore the
thermodynamics and dynamics of self assembly as a function of the parameters of
the model and find robust assembly of all target structures considered. Optimal
assembly occurs in the region of parameter space where a free energy barrier
regulates the rate of nucleation, thus preventing the premature exhaustion of
the supply of monomers that can lead to the formation of incomplete shells. The
interactions also need to be specific enough to prevent the assembly of
malformed shells, but whilst maintaining kinetic accessibility. Free-energy
landscapes computed for our model have a funnel-like topography guiding the
system to form the target structure, and show that the torsional component of
the interparticle interactions prevents the formation of disordered aggregates
that would otherwise act as kinetic traps.

revealed two distinct morphological and functional states, namely a
non-migrating symmetric unpolarized state and a migrating asymmetric polarized
state. These states are characterized by different spatial distributions and
dynamics of important biochemical cell components: F-actin and myosin-II form
the contractile part of the cytoskeleton, and integrin receptors in the plasma
membrane connect F-actin filaments to the substratum. In this way, focal
adhesion complexes are assembled, which determine cytoskeletal force
transduction and subsequent cell locomotion. So far, physical models have
reduced this phenomenon either to gradients in regulatory control molecules or
to different mechanics of the actin filament system in different regions of the
cell.
  Here we offer an alternative and self-organizational model incorporating
polymerization, pushing and sliding of filaments, as well as formation of
adhesion sites and their force dependent kinetics. All these phenomena can be
combined into a non-linearly coupled system of hyperbolic, parabolic and
elliptic differential equations. Aim of this article is to show how relatively
simple relations for the small-scale mechanics and kinetics of participating
molecules may reproduce the emergent behavior of polarization and migration on
the large-scale cell level.

Brody distribution with parameter $\beta\simeq 0.8$. This finding, supported by
other consistent indicators, implies a novel quantitative criterion to single
out the collective degrees of freedom of the protein from the majority of
high-energy, localized vibrations.

nucleation times and to address its role in the context of eukaryotic
chemotaxis (i.e. the process which allows cells to identify and follow a
gradient of chemical attractant). As a first step in this direction we study
the nucleation dynamics of the 2d Ising model defined on a cylindrical lattice
whose radius changes as a function of time. Geometry variation is obtained by
changing the relative value of the couplings between spins in the compactified
(vertical) direction with respect to the horizontal one. This allows us to keep
the lattice size unchanged and study in a single simulation the values of the
compactification radius which change in time. We show, both with theoretical
arguments and numerical simulations that squeezing the geometry allows the
system to speed up nucleation times even in presence of a very small energy gap
between the stable and the metastable states. We then address the implications
of our analysis for directional chemotaxis. The initial steps of chemotaxis can
be modelled as a nucleation process occurring on the cell membrane as a
consequence of the external chemical gradient (which plays the role of energy
gap between the stable and metastable phases). In nature most of the cells
modify their geometry by extending quasi-onedimensional protrusions (filopodia)
so as to enhance their sensitivity to chemoattractant. Our results show that
this geometry variation has indeed the effect of greatly decreasing the
timescale of the nucleation process even in presence of very small amounts of
chemoattractants.

semiflexible polymers under intermediate tension, the force range where a chain
is partially extended but not in the asymptotic regime of a nearly straight
contour. The theory is designed to exactly reproduce the lowest order
equilibrium averages of a stretched polymer, and treats the full complexity of
the problem: the resulting dynamics include the coupled effects of long-range
hydrodynamic interactions, backbone stiffness, and large-scale polymer contour
fluctuations. Validated by Brownian hydrodynamics simulations and comparison to
optical tweezer measurements on stretched DNA, the theory is highly accurate in
the intermediate tension regime over a broad dynamical range, without the need
for additional dynamic fitting parameters.

divide and may differentiate into post-mitotic cells. We derive an exact
solution of this model in terms of generating functions for the total number of
cells, and for the number of cells of different types. We also deduce large
time asymptotic behaviors drawing on our exact results, and on an independent
diffusion approximation.

formed from a symmetric chemical system, in the absence of any asymmetric
influence other than statistical fluctuations, have been developed during the
last decades, focusing on the non-linear kinetic aspects. Besides the absolute
necessity of self-amplification processes, the importance of energetic aspects
is often underestimated. Going down to the most fundamental aspects, the
distinction between a single object -- that can be intrinsically asymmetric --
and a collection of objects -- whose racemic state is the more stable one --
must be emphasized. A system of strongly interacting objects can be described
as one single object retaining its individuality and a single asymmetry; weakly
or non-interacting objects keep their own individuality, and are prone to
racemize towards the equilibrium state. In the presence of energy fluxes,
systems can be maintained in an asymmetric non-equilibrium steady-state. Such
dynamical systems can retain their asymmetry for times longer than their
racemization time.

universal patterns beyond superficial discrepancies across different cultures
is a major breakthrough in cognitive science. As observed in the World Color
Survey (WCS), indeed, any two groups of individuals develop quite different
categorization patterns, but some universal properties can be identified by a
statistical analysis over a large number of populations. Here, we reproduce the
WCS in a numerical model in which different populations develop independently
their own categorization systems by playing elementary language games. We find
that a simple perceptual constraint shared by all humans, namely the human Just
Noticeable Difference (JND), is sufficient to trigger the emergence of
universal patterns that unconstrained cultural interaction fails to produce. We
test the results of our experiment against real data by performing the same
statistical analysis proposed to quantify the universal tendencies shown in the
WCS [Kay P and Regier T. (2003) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 100: 9085-9089], and
obtain an excellent quantitative agreement. This work confirms that synthetic
modeling has nowadays reached the maturity to contribute significantly to the
ongoing debate in cognitive science.

act as electrical transmission lines. An electrical circuit model of the
microtubule is constructed incorporating features of its cylindrical structure
with nanopores in its walls. This model is used to study how ionic conductance
along the lumen is affected by flux through the nanopores when an external
potential is applied across its two ends. Based on the results of Brownian
dynamics simulations, the nanopores were found to have asymmetric inner and
outer conductances, manifested as nonlinear IV curves. Our simulations indicate
that a combination of this asymmetry and an internal voltage source arising
from the motion of the C-terminal tails causes a net current to be pumped
across the microtubule wall and propagate down the microtubule through the
lumen. This effect is demonstrated to enhance and add directly to the
longitudinal current through the lumen resulting from an external voltage
source, and could be significant in amplifying low-intensity endogenous
currents within the cellular environment or as a nano-bioelectronic device.

expression, is common among microbes, and may be important in coping with
changing environments. We use a theoretical model to assess whether such
switching is a good strategy for growth in environments with occasional
catastrophic events. We find that switching can be advantageous, but only when
the environment is responsive to the microbial population. In our model,
microbes switch randomly between two phenotypic states, with different growth
rates. The environment undergoes sudden "catastrophes", the probability of
which depends on the composition of the population. We derive a simple
analytical result for the population growth rate. For a responsive environment,
two alternative strategies emerge. In the "no switching" strategy, the
population maximises its instantaneous growth rate, regardless of catastrophes.
In the "switching" strategy, the microbial switching rate is tuned to minimise
the environmental response. Which of these strategies is most favourable
depends on the parameters of the model. Previous studies have shown that
microbial switching can be favourable when the environment changes in an
unresponsive fashion between several states. Here, we demonstrate an
alternative role for phase variation in allowing microbes to maximise their
growth in catastrophic responsive environments.

incorporating the regulation through cellular phosphatases. Activation induced
the alignment of a phosphatase cascade in parallel with the MAP kinase pathway.
A novel regulatory motif was thus generated, providing for the combinatorial
control of each MAPK intermediate. This ensured a non-linear mode of signal
transmission with the output being shaped by the balance between the strength
of input signal, and the activity gradient along the phosphatase axis. Shifts
in this balance yielded modulations in topology of the motif, thereby expanding
the repertoire of output responses. Thus we identify an added dimension to
signal processing, wherein the output response to an external stimulus is
additionally filtered through indicators that define the phenotypic status of
the cell.

systems. In Fokker-Planck theory, this leads to a vanishing probability density
near the absorbing boundary of threshold models. Here we derive the boundary
condition for the stationary density of a first-order stochastic differential
equation for additive finite-grained Poisson noise and show that the response
properties of threshold units are qualitatively altered. Applied to the
integrate-and-fire neuron model, the response turns out to be instantaneous
rather than exhibiting low-pass characteristics, highly non-linear, and
asymmetric for excitation and inhibition. The novel mechanism is exhibited on
the network level and is a generic property of pulse-coupled systems of
threshold units.

tree $T = (V,E)$ with irreducible edge transition matrix $M$, where $b \geq 2$,
$k \geq 2$ and $[k] = \{1,...,k\}$. We denote by $L_n$ the level-$n$ vertices
of $T$. Assume $M$ has a real second-largest (in absolute value) eigenvalue
$\lambda$ with corresponding real eigenvector $\nu \neq 0$. Letting $\sigma_v =
\nu_{\xi_v}$, we consider the following root-state estimator, which was
introduced by Mossel and Peres (2003) in the context of the "recontruction
problem" on trees: \begin{equation*} S_n = (b\lambda)^{-n} \sum_{x\in L_n}
\sigma_x. \end{equation*} As noted by Mossel and Peres, when $b\lambda^2 &gt; 1$
(the so-called Kesten-Stigum reconstruction phase) the quantity $S_n$ has
uniformly bounded variance. Here, we give bounds on the moment-generating
functions of $S_n$ and $S_n^2$ when $b\lambda^2 &gt; 1$. Our results have
implications for the inference of evolutionary trees.

provably achieves, at sufficiently short branch lengths, a polylogarithmic
sequence-length requirement -- improving significantly over previous polynomial
bounds for distance-based methods. The technique is based on an averaging
procedure that implicitly reconstructs ancestral sequences.
  In the same token, we extend previous results on phase transitions in
phylogeny reconstruction to general time-reversible models. More precisely, we
show that in the so-called Kesten-Stigum zone (roughly, a region of the
parameter space where ancestral sequences are well approximated by ``linear
combinations'' of the observed sequences) sequences of length $\poly(\log n)$
suffice for reconstruction when branch lengths are discretized. Here $n$ is the
number of extant species.
  Our results challenge, to some extent, the conventional wisdom that estimates
of evolutionary distances alone carry significantly less information about
phylogenies than full sequence datasets.

complex: thousands of individuals form multiple flocks which are continually
changing shape and density, while splitting and merging. To understand these
complex displays both empirical data and models are needed. Whereas detailed
empirical data were recently collected through video recordings and position
measurements by stereo photography of flocks of thousands of starlings, there
are as yet no models that generate these complex patterns. Numerous computer
models in biology, however, suggest that patterns of single groups of moving
animals may emerge by self-organisation from movement and local coordination
(through attraction, alignment and avoidance of collision). In this paper, we
investigated whether this approach can be extended to generate patterns
resembling these aerial displays of starlings. We show in a model that to
generate many of the patterns measured empirically in real starlings we have to
extend the usual rules of local coordination with specifics of starling
behaviour, mainly 1) their aerial locomotion, 2) a low and constant number of
interaction-partners and 3) preferential movement above a roosting area. Our
model can be used as a tool for the study of these displays, because it
provides new integrative hypotheses about the mechanisms underlying these
displays and of swarming patterns in biological systems in general.

Accepted to Ecological Modelling</comments><license>http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/</license><abstract>  Linyphiid spiders have evolved the ability to disperse long distances by a
process known as ballooning. It has been hypothesized that ballooning may allow
populations to persist in the highly disturbed agricultural areas that the
spiders prefer. In this study, I develop a stochastic population model to
explore how the propensity for this type of long distance dispersal influences
long term population persistence in a heterogeneous landscape where
catastrophic mortality events are common. Analysis of this model indicates that
although some dispersal does indeed decrease the probability of extinction of
the population, the frequency of dispersal is only important in certain
extremes. Instead, both the mean population birth and death rates, and the
landscape composition, are much more important in determining the probability
of extinction than the dispersal process. Thus, in order to develop effective
conservation strategies for these spiders, better understanding of life history
processes should be prioritized over an understanding of dispersal strategies.

(metastable) "chimera" states in which synchronisation and desynchronisation
co-exist. The oscillators are organised into communities, such that each
oscillator is connected to all its peers in the same community and to a subset
of the oscillators in other communities. Measures are introduced for
quantifying metastability, the prevalence of chimera states, and the variety of
such states a system generates. By simulation, it is shown that each of these
measures is maximised when the phase lag of the model is close, but not equal,
to pi/2. The relevance of the model to a number of fields is briefly discussed,
with particular emphasis on brain dynamics.

calculation of conduction velocity restitution curves in ionic models of
cardiac excitability. Conduction velocity restitution is the simplest
nontrivial spatially extended problem in excitable media, and in the case of
cardiac tissue it is an important tool for prediction of cardiac arrhythmias
and fibrillation. An idealized conduction velocity restitution curve requires
solving a nonlinear eigenvalue problem with periodic boundary conditions, which
in the cardiac case is very stiff and calls for the use of asymptotic methods.
We compare asymptotics of restitution curves in four examples, two generic
excitable media models, and two ionic cardiac models. The generic models
include the classical FitzHugh-Nagumo model and its variation by Barkley. They
are treated with standard singular perturbation techniques. The ionic models
include a simplified "caricature" of the Noble (1962) model and the Beeler and
Reuter (1977) model, which lead to non-Tikhonov problems where known asymptotic
results do not apply. The Caricature Noble model is considered with particular
care to demonstrate the well-posedness of the corresponding boundary-value
problem. The developed method for calculation of conduction velocity
restitution is then applied to the Beeler-Reuter model. We discuss new
mathematical features appearing in cardiac ionic models and possible
applications of the developed method.

define the key features typically present in such networks and of particular
relevance to biological cellular neural networks: Dynamics, signaling,
observation, and control. The framework is particularly well-suited for
estimating functional connectivity in cellular neural networks from
experimentally observable data, and has been implemented using graphics
processing unit (GPU) high performance computing. Computationally, the
framework can simulate cellular network signaling close to or faster than real
time. We further propose a standard test set of networks to measure performance
and compare different mapping algorithms.

RNA secondary structures is $1.104366 n^{-3/2} 2.618034^n$. In this paper, we
study combinatorial asymptotics for two special subclasses of RNA secondary
structures - canonical and saturated structures. Canonical secondary structures
were introduced by Bompf\"unewerer et al., who noted that the run time of
Vienna RNA Package is substantially reduced when restricting computations to
canonical structures. Here we provide an explanation for the speed-up.
Saturated secondary structures have the property that no base pairs can be
added without violating the definition of secondary structure (i.e. introducing
a pseudoknot or base triple). Here we compute the asymptotic number of
saturated structures, we show that the asymptotic expected number of base pairs
is $0.337361 n$, and the asymptotic number of saturated stem-loop structures is
$0.323954 1.69562^n$, in contrast to the number $2^{n-2}$ of (arbitrary)
stem-loop structures as classically computed by Stein and Waterman. Finally, we
show that the density of states for [all resp. canonical resp. saturated]
secondary structures is asymptotically Gaussian. We introduce a stochastic
greedy method to sample random saturated structures, called quasi-random
saturated structures, and show that the expected number of base pairs of is
$0.340633 n$.

groups and frequent inter-group conflicts), coevolution of gene-related
behavior and culturally transmitted group-level institutions provides a
plausible explanation for the parochial altruistic and reciprocator traits of
most modern humans. When, with the agricultural revolution, societies became
larger and more complex, the collective nature of the monitoring and punishment
of norm violators was no longer effective. This led to the emergence of new
institutions of governance and social hierarchies. Likely, the smooth
acceptance of the new institutions was possible only because, in the majority
of the population, the reciprocator trait had become an internalized norm.
However the new ruling class has its own dynamics which in turn may lead to new
social crisis. Using a simple model, inspired on previous work by Bowles and
Gintis, these effects are studied here.

network concept. Transport plays a key role in the survival of networks. For
example the specialized signaling cascades of cellular networks filter noise
and efficiently adapt the network structure to new stimuli. However, our
general understanding of transport mechanisms and signaling pathways in complex
systems is yet limited. Here we summarize the key network structures involved
in transport, list the solutions available to overloaded systems for relaxing
their load and outline a possible method for the computational determination of
signaling pathways. We highlight that in addition to hubs, bridges and the
network skeleton, the overlapping modular structure is also essential in
network transport. Moreover, by locating network elements in the space of
overlapping network modules and evaluating their distance in this "module
space", it may be possible to approximate signaling pathways computationally,
which, in turn could serve the identification of signaling pathways of complex
systems. Our model may be applicable in a wide range of fields including
traffic control or drug design.

compatibility, the first integral of the shape equation should vanish for
axisymmetric lipid membranes, from which two theorems of non-existence are
verified: (i) There is no axisymmetric open membrane being a part of torus
satisfying the shape equation; (ii) There is no axisymmetric open membrane
being a part of a biconcave discodal surface satisfying the shape equation.
Additionally, the shape equation is reduced to a second-order differential
equation while the boundary conditions are reduced to two equations due to this
compatibility. Numerical solutions to the reduced shape equation and boundary
conditions agree well with the experimental data [A. Saitoh \emph{et al.},
Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA \textbf{95}, 1026 (1998)].

First, we survey the techniques developed in

the division (birth) rate from the cell volume distribution data in certain
structured population models. Secondly, we implement such techniques on
experimental cell volume distributions available in the literature so as to
validate the theoretical and numerical results. As a proof of concept, we use
the data reported in the classical work of Kubitschek [3] concerning
Escherichia coli in vitro experiments measured by means of a Coulter
transducer-multichannel analyzer system (Coulter Electronics, Inc., Hialeah,
Fla, USA.) Despite the rather old measurement technology, the reconstructed
division rates still display potentially useful biological features.

precisely transit through the ribosomal A, P and E sites during translation
remains a major goal in the study of protein synthesis. Here, we report the
real-time dynamics of the L1 stalk, a structural element of the large ribosomal
subunit that is implicated in directing tRNA movements during translation.
Within pre-translocation ribosomal complexes, the L1 stalk exists in a dynamic
equilibrium between open and closed conformations. Binding of elongation factor
G (EF-G) shifts this equilibrium towards the closed conformation through one of
at least two distinct kinetic mechanisms, where the identity of the P-site tRNA
dictates the kinetic route that is taken. Within post-translocation complexes,
L1 stalk dynamics are dependent on the presence and identity of the E-site
tRNA. Collectively, our data demonstrate that EF-G and the L1 stalk
allosterically collaborate to direct tRNA translocation from the P to the E
sites, and suggest a model for the release of E-site tRNA.

model for hematopoiesis. This PDE model is derived from the original
agent-based model formulated by (Roeder et al., Nat. Med., 2006), and it
describes the progression of blood cell development from the stem cell to the
terminally differentiated state. To conduct our analysis, we start with the PDE
model of (Kim et al, JTB, 2007), which coincides very well with the simulation
results obtained by Roeder et al. We simplify the PDE model to make it amenable
to analysis and justify our approximations using numerical simulations. An
analysis of the simplified PDE model proves to exhibit very similar properties
to those of the original agent-based model, even if for slightly different
parameters. Hence, the simplified model is of value in understanding the
dynamics of hematopoiesis and of chronic myelogenous leukemia, and it presents
the advantage of having fewer parameters, which makes comparison with both
experimental data and alternative models much easier.

namely the multiple-hidden i.i.d. model, which is derived from multiple
alignment algorithms. We first provide a rigorous formalism for the homology
structure of k sequences related by a star-shaped phylogenetic tree in the
context of multiple alignment based on indel evolution models. We discuss
possible definitions of likelihoods and compare them to the criterion used in
multiple alignment algorithms. Existence of two different Information
divergence rates is established and a divergence property is shown under
additional assumptions. This would yield consistency for the parameter in
parametrization schemes for which the divergence property holds. We finally
extend the definition of the multiple-hidden i.i.d. model and the results
obtained to the case in which the sequences are related by an arbitrary
phylogenetic tree. Simulations illustrate different cases which are not covered
by our results.

bioinformatics programs used today. Applications range widely from comparative
gene prediction to time-series analyses of micro-array data. The parameters of
the underlying models need to be adjusted for specific data sets, for example
the genome of a particular species, in order to maximize the prediction
accuracy. Computationally efficient algorithms for parameter training are thus
key to maximizing the usability of a wide range of bioinformatics applications.
  Results: We introduce two computationally efficient training algorithms, one
for Viterbi training and one for stochastic expectation maximization (EM)
training, which render the memory requirements independent of the sequence
length. Unlike the existing algorithms for Viterbi and stochastic EM training
which require a two-step procedure, our two new algorithms require only one
step and scan the input sequence in only one direction. We also implement these
two new algorithms and the already published linear-memory algorithm for EM
training into the hidden Markov model compiler HMM-Converter and examine their
respective practical merits for three small example models.
  Conclusions: Bioinformatics applications employing hidden Markov models can
use the two algorithms in order to make Viterbi training and stochastic EM
training more computationally efficient. Using these algorithms, parameter
training can thus be attempted for more complex models and longer training
sequences. The two new algorithms have the added advantage of being easier to
implement than the corresponding default algorithms for Viterbi training and
stochastic EM training.

illuminating prehistorical events and serving as null models in genome scans
for selection. We introduce an inference method based on the joint frequency
spectrum of genetic variants within and between populations. For candidate
models we numerically compute the expected spectrum using a diffusion
approximation to the one-locus two-allele Wright-Fisher process, involving up
to three simultaneous populations. Our approach is a composite likelihood
scheme, since linkage between neutral loci alters the variance but not the
expectation of the frequency spectrum. We thus use bootstraps incorporating
linkage to estimate uncertainties for parameters and significance values for
hypothesis tests. Our method can also incorporate selection on single sites,
predicting the joint distribution of selected alleles among populations
experiencing a bevy of evolutionary forces, including expansions, contractions,
migrations, and admixture. As applications, we model human expansion out of
Africa and the settlement of the New World, using 5 Mb of noncoding DNA
resequenced in 68 individuals from 4 populations (YRI, CHB, CEU, and MXL) by
the Environmental Genome Project. We also combine our demographic model with a
previously estimated distribution of selective effects among newly arising
amino acid mutations to accurately predict the frequency spectrum of
nonsynonymous variants across three continental populations (YRI, CHB, CEU).

  Isoforms in Rainbow Trout</title><categories>physics.bio-ph physics.comp-ph q-bio.BM</categories><comments>13 pages, 4 figures, and 2 table</comments><license>http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/</license><abstract>  Molecular dynamics simulations were used to determine the binding affinities
between between the hormone 17 beta-estradiol (E2) and different estrogen
receptor (ER) isoforms in the rainbow trout, Oncorhynchus mykiss. Previous
phylogenetic analysis indicates that a whole genome duplication prior to the
divergence of ray-finned fish led to two distinct ER beta isoforms, ER beta 1
and ER beta 2, and the recent whole genome duplication in the ancestral
salmonid created two ER alpha isoforms, ER alpha 1 and ER alpha 2. The
objective of our computational studies is to provide insight into the
underlying evolutionary pressures on these isoforms. For the ER alpha subtype
our results show that E2 binds preferentially to ER alpha 1 over ER alpha 2.
Tests of lineage specific dN/dS ratios indicate that the ligand binding domain
of the ER alpha 2 gene is evolving under relaxed selection relative to all
other ER alpha genes. Comparison with the highly conserved DNA binding domain
suggests that ER alpha 2 may be undergoing neofunctionalization possibly by
binding to another ligand. By contrast, both ER beta 1 and ER beta 2 bind
similarly to E2 and the best fitting model of selection indicates that the
ligand binding domain of all ER beta genes are evolving under the same level of
purifying selection, comparable to ER alpha 1.

opinions mainly because of the weak interaction between the two communities. In
such a case, it is an interesting problem to find the necessary strength of
inter-community interaction in order for the two communities to reach a
consensus. In this paper, the Information Accumulation System (IAS) model is
applied to investigate the problem. With the application of the IAS model, the
opinion dynamics of the two-community problem is found to belong to a wider
class of two-species problems appearing in population dynamics or in
competition of two languages, for all of which the governing equations can be
described in terms of coupled logistic maps. Tipping diffusivity is defined as
the maximal inter-community interaction that the two communities can stay in
different opinions. For a problem with simple community structure and
homogeneous individuals, the tipping diffusivity is calculated theoretically.
As a conclusion of the paper, the convergence of the two communities to the
same value is less possible the more overall interaction, intra-community and
inter-community, takes place. This implies, for example, that the increase in
the interaction between individuals caused by the development of modern
communication tools, such as facebook and twitter, does not necessarily improve
the tendency towards global convergence between different communities. If the
number of internal links increases by a factor, the number of inter-community
links must be increased by an even higher factor, in order for consensus to be
the only stable attractor.

function, with an application to expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL)
mapping, where the goal is to discover genetic variations that influence
gene-expression levels. In particular, we investigate a shrinkage technique
capable of capturing a given hierarchical structure over the responses, such as
a hierarchical clustering tree with leaf nodes for responses and internal nodes
for clusters of related responses at multiple granularity, and we seek to
leverage this structure to recover covariates relevant to each
hierarchically-defined cluster of responses. We propose a tree-guided group
lasso, or tree lasso, for estimating such structured sparsity under
multi-response regression by employing a novel penalty function constructed
from the tree. We describe a systematic weighting scheme for the overlapping
groups in the tree-penalty such that each regression coefficient is penalized
in a balanced manner despite the inhomogeneous multiplicity of group
memberships of the regression coefficients due to overlaps among groups. For
efficient optimization, we employ a smoothing proximal gradient method that was
originally developed for a general class of structured-sparsity-inducing
penalties. Using simulated and yeast data sets, we demonstrate that our method
shows a superior performance in terms of both prediction errors and recovery of
true sparsity patterns, compared to other methods for learning a
multivariate-response regression.

cascades of primarily enzymatic reactions realizing computing gates, such as
AND, OR, etc., as well as progress in networking these gates and coupling of
the resulting systems to smart/responsive electrodes for output readout, have
opened new biosensing opportunities. Here we survey existing enabling research
results, as well as ideas and research avenues for future development of a new
paradigm of digitally operating biosensors logically processing multiple
biochemical signals through Boolean logic networks composed of biomolecular
reactions, yielding the final output signals as YES/NO responses. Such systems
can lead to high-fidelity biosensing compared to common single or parallel

inverse Ising problem. The equilibrium behavior of Hopfield networks is
simulated through Glauber dynamics. In the low temperature regime, the
simulated annealing technique is adopted. Although performances of these
network reconstruction algorithms on the simulated network of spiking neurons
are extensively studied recently, the analysis of Hopfield networks is lacking
so far. For the Hopfield network, we found that, in the retrieval phase favored
when the network wants to memory one of stored patterns, all the reconstruction
algorithms fail to extract interactions within a desired accuracy, and the same
failure occurs in the spin glass phase where spurious minima show up, while in
the paramagnetic phase, albeit unfavored during the retrieval dynamics, the
algorithms work well to reconstruct the network itself. This implies that, as a
inverse problem, the paramagnetic phase is conversely useful for reconstructing
the network while the retrieval phase loses all the information about
interactions in the network except for the case where only one pattern is
stored. The performances of algorithms are studied with respect to the system
size, memory load and temperature, sample-to-sample fluctuations are also
considered.

dynamics if the number of genes is odd (they oscillate) or even (they exhibit
bistability). However, these attractors may not fully explain the observed
behavior in transient and stochastic environments such as the cell. We show
here that even repressilators possess quasi-stable, travelling-wave periodic
solutions that are reachable, long-lived and robust to parameter changes. These
solutions underlie the sustained oscillations observed in even rings in the
stochastic regime, even if these circuits are expected to behave as switches.
The existence of such solutions can also be exploited for control purposes:
operation of the system around the quasi-stable orbit allows us to turn on and
off the oscillations reliably and on demand. We illustrate these ideas with a
simple protocol based on optical interference that can induce oscillations
robustly both in the stochastic and deterministic regimes.

networks with community structure) is proposed. The immunization of networks
aims at fragmenting networks into small parts with a small number of removed
nodes. Its applications include prevention of epidemic spreading, intentional
attacks on networks, and conservation of ecosystems. Although preferential
immunization of hubs is efficient, good immunization strategies for modular
networks have not been established. On the basis of an immunization strategy
based on the eigenvector centrality, we develop an analytical framework for
immunizing modular networks. To this end, we quantify the contribution of each
node to the connectivity in a coarse-grained network among modules. We verify
the effectiveness of the proposed method by applying it to model and real
networks with modular structure.

occur with constant probabilities. Each new species is associated with a
fitness sampled from the uniform distribution on [0,1]. Every time there is a
death event then the type that is killed is the one with the smallest fitness.
We show that there is a sharp phase transition when the birth probability is
larger than the death probability. The set of species with fitness higher than
a certain critical value approach an uniform distribution. On the other hand
all the species with fitness less than the critical disappear after a finite
(random) time.

selection is analyzed. Results are obtained using techniques from Karlin (1982)
that overcome the weak selection constraints needed for tractability in prior
studies of multilocus event models. A multivariate form of the reduction
principle is found: reduction results at individual loci combine topologically
to produce a surface of mutation rate alterations that are neutral for a new
modifier allele. New mutation rates survive if and only if they fall below this
surface - a generalization of the hyperplane found by Zhivotovsky et al. (1994)
for a multilocus recombination modifier. Increases in mutation rates at some
loci may evolve if compensated for by decreases at other loci. The strength of
selection on the modifier scales in proportion to the number of germline cell
divisions, and increases with the number of loci affected. Loci that do not
make a difference to marginal fitnesses at equilibrium are not subject to the
reduction principle, and under fine tuning of mutation rates would be expected
to have higher mutation rates than loci in mutation-selection balance. Other
results include the nonexistence of 'viability analogous, Hardy-Weinberg'
modifier polymorphisms under multiplicative mutation, and the sufficiency of
average transmission rates to encapsulate the effect of modifier polymorphisms
on the transmission of loci under selection. A conjecture is offered regarding
situations, like recombination in the presence of mutation, that exhibit
departures from the reduction principle. Constraints for tractability are:
tight linkage of all loci, initial fixation at the modifier locus, and mutation
distributions comprising transition probabilities of reversible Markov chains.

edge of a crawling cell to probe its upcoming environment. {\it In vitro}
experiments [D. Vignjevic {\it et al.}, J. Cell Biol. {\bf 160}, 951 (2003)]
have determined the minimal ingredients required for the formation of filopodia
from the dendritic-like morphology of the leading edge. We model these
experiments using kinetic aggregation equations for the density of growing
bundle tips. In mean field, we determine the bundle size distribution to be
broad for bundle sizes smaller than a characteristic bundle size above which
the distribution decays exponentially. Two-dimensional simulations
incorporating both bundling and cross-linking measure a bundle size
distribution that agrees qualitatively with mean field. The simulations also
demonstrate a nonmonotonicity in the radial extent of the dendritic region as a
function of capping protein concentration, as was observed in experiments, due
to the interplay between percolation and the ratcheting of growing filaments
off a spherical obstacle.

one parameter, the ratio between total genetic map length ($G$) and physical
map length ($P$), measured in centiMorgans per Megabase (cM/Mb). The value of
this parameter varies greatly between species, but the cause for these
differences is not entirely clear. A constraining factor of overall $RR$ in a
species, which may cause increased $RR$ for smaller chromosomes, is the
requirement of at least one chiasma per chromosome (or chromosome-arm) per
meiosis. In the present study, we quantify the relative excess of recombination
events on smaller chromosomes by a linear regression model, which relates the
genetic length of chromosomes to their physical length. We find for several
species that the two-parameter regression, $G= G_0 + k \cdot P$ provides a
better characterization of the relationship between genetic and physical map
length than the one-parameter regression that runs through the origin. A
non-zero intercept ($G_0$) indicates a relative excess of recombination on
smaller chromosomes in a genome. Given $G_0$, the parameter $k$ predicts the
increase of genetic map length over the increase of physical map length. The
observed values of $G_0$ have a similar magnitude for diverse species, whereas
$k$ varies by two orders of magnitude. The implications of this strategy for
the genetic maps of human, mouse, rat, chicken, honeybee, worm and yeast are
discussed.

number alteration (in somatic cells) are of great interest for human disease
gene mapping and cancer studies. They represent a new type of mutation and are
larger-scaled than the single nucleotide polymorphisms. Using genotyping
microarray for copy number variation detection has become standard, and there
is a need for improving analysis methods. Results: We apply the cumulative plot
to the detection of regions with copy number variation/alteration, on samples
taken from a chronic lymphocytic leukemia patient. Two sets of whole-genome
genotyping of 317k single nucleotide polymorphisms, one from the normal cell
and another from the cancer cell, are analyzed. We demonstrate the utility of
cumulative plot in detecting a 9Mb (9 x 10^6 bases) hemizygous deletion and 1Mb
homozygous deletion on chromosome 13. We also show the possibility to detect
smaller copy number variation/alteration regions below the 100kb range.
Conclusions: As a graphic tool, the cumulative plot is an intuitive and a
scale-free (window-less) way for detecting copy number variation/alteration
regions, especially when such regions are small.

construct partially directed graphs for the following four variables:
GC-content, recombination rate, exon density and distance-to-telomere.
Recombination rate and exon density are unconditionally uncorrelated, but
become inversely correlated by conditioning on GC-content. This pattern
indicates a model where recombination rate and exon density are two independent
causes of GC-content variation. {\bf Conclusions}: Causal inference and
graphical models are useful methods to understand genome evolution and the
mechanisms of isochore evolution in the human genome.

are known to posses spontaneous (intrinsic) curvature. Using a simple extension
of the wormlike chain model, we study the response of a weakly bending filament
in two dimensions to a pulling force applied at its ends (a configuration
common in classical in-vitro experiments and relevant to several in-vivo cell
cases). The spontaneous curvature of such a chain or filament can in general be
arc-length dependent and we study a case of sinusoidal variation, from which an
arbitrary case can be reconstructed via Fourier transformation. We obtain
analytic results for the force-extension relationship and the width of
transverse fluctuations. We show that spontaneous-curvature undulations can
affect the force-extension behavior even in relatively flexible filaments with
a persistence length smaller than the contour length.

While
this process is simple for fitness landscapes where mutations are independent,
the interaction between mutations (epistasis) as well as mutations at loci that
affect more than one trait (pleiotropy) are crucial in complex and realistic
fitness landscapes. We investigate the impact of epistasis and pleiotropy on
adaptive evolution by studying the evolution of a population of asexual haploid
organisms (haplotypes) in a model of N interacting loci, where each locus
interacts with K other loci. We use a quantitative measure of the magnitude of
epistatic interactions between substitutions, and find that it is an increasing
function of K. When haplotypes adapt at high mutation rates, more epistatic
pairs of substitutions are observed on the line of descent than expected. The
highest fitness is attained in landscapes with an intermediate amount of
ruggedness that balance the higher fitness potential of interacting genes with
their concomitant decreased evolvability. Our findings imply that the synergism
between loci that interact epistatically is crucial for evolving genetic
modules with high fitness, while too much ruggedness stalls the adaptive
process.

ranging from job performance and mental health, to sports, business, and
combat. Some authors have suggested that not just confidence but
overconfidence-believing you are better than you are in reality-is advantageous
because it serves to increase ambition, morale, resolve, persistence, or the
credibility of bluffing, generating a self-fulfilling prophecy in which
exaggerated confidence actually increases the probability of success. However,
overconfidence also leads to faulty assessments, unrealistic expectations, and
hazardous decisions, so it remains a puzzle how such a false belief could
evolve or remain stable in a population of competing strategies that include
accurate, unbiased beliefs. Here, we present an evolutionary model showing
that, counter-intuitively, overconfidence maximizes individual fitness and
populations will tend to become overconfident, as long as benefits from
contested resources are sufficiently large compared to the cost of competition.
In contrast, "rational" unbiased strategies are only stable under limited
conditions. The fact that overconfident populations are evolutionarily stable
in a wide range of environments may help to explain why overconfidence remains
prevalent today, even if it contributes to hubris, market bubbles, financial
collapses, policy failures, disasters, and costly wars.

For the first time, we report the anomalous drift of spiral waves towards

reaction-diffusion models of excitable media. Such anomalous drift can promote
the onset of complex spatio-temporal patterns, e.g., those responsible for
life-threatening arrhythmias in the heart.

range of cytoskeletal structures, and their mechanical properties play key
roles in cellular functions ranging from locomotion to mechanotransduction and
fertilization. We give a detailed derivation of a wormlike bundle model as a
generic description for the statics and dynamics of polymer bundles consisting
of semiflexible polymers interconnected by crosslinking agents. The elastic
degrees of freedom include bending as well as twist deformations of the
filaments and shear deformation of the crosslinks. We show that a competition
between the elastic properties of the filaments and those of the crosslinks
leads to renormalized effective bend and twist rigidities that become
mode-number dependent. The strength and character of this dependence is found
to vary with bundle architecture, such as the arrangement of filaments in the
cross section and pretwist. We discuss two paradigmatic cases of bundle
architecture, a uniform arrangement of filaments as found in F-actin bundles
and a shell-like architecture as characteristic for microtubules. Each
architecture is found to have its own universal ratio of maximal to minimal
bending rigidity, independent of the specific type of crosslink induced
filament coupling; our predictions are in reasonable agreement with available
experimental data for microtubules. Moreover, we analyze the predictions of the
wormlike bundle model for experimental observables such as the tangent-tangent
correlation function and dynamic response and correlation functions. Finally,
we analyze the effect of pretwist (helicity) on the mechanical properties of
bundles. We predict that microtubules with different number of protofilaments
should have distinct variations in their effective bending rigidity.

to, but phenotypically different from other normally growing bacteria. These
so-called persister cells keep themselves in a dormant state and thus are
insensitive to antibiotic treatment, resulting in serious problems of drug
resistance. In this paper, we proposed a novel strategy to "kill" persister
cells by triggering them to switch, in a fast and synchronized way, into
normally growing cells that are susceptible to antibiotics. The strategy is
based on resonant activation (RA), a well-studied phenomenon in physics where
the internal noise of a system can constructively facilitate fast and
synchronized barrier crossings. Through stochastic Gilliespie simulation with a
generic toggle switch model, we demonstrated that RA exists in the phenotypic
switching of a single bacterium. Further, by coupling single cell level and
population level simulations, we showed that with RA, one can greatly reduce
the time and total amount of antibiotics needed to sterilize a bacterial
population. We suggest that resonant activation is a general phenomenon in
phenotypic transition, and can find other applications such as cancer therapy.

module identification technique called modularity maximization is not well
understood in practical contexts. Here, we present a broad characterization of
its performance in such situations. First, we revisit and clarify the
resolution limit phenomenon for modularity maximization. Second, we show that
the modularity function Q exhibits extreme degeneracies: it typically admits an
exponential number of distinct high-scoring solutions and typically lacks a
clear global maximum. Third, we derive the limiting behavior of the maximum
modularity Q_max for one model of infinitely modular networks, showing that it
depends strongly both on the size of the network and on the number of modules
it contains. Finally, using three real-world metabolic networks as examples, we
show that the degenerate solutions can fundamentally disagree on many, but not
all, partition properties such as the composition of the largest modules and
the distribution of module sizes. These results imply that the output of any
modularity maximization procedure should be interpreted cautiously in
scientific contexts. They also explain why many heuristics are often successful
at finding high-scoring partitions in practice and why different heuristics can
disagree on the modular structure of the same network. We conclude by
discussing avenues for mitigating some of these behaviors, such as combining
information from many degenerate solutions or using generative models.

information processing (biocomputing). Extensive ongoing research in
biocomputing, mimicking Boolean logic gates has been motivated by potential
applications in biotechnology and medicine. Furthermore, novel sensor concepts
have been contemplated with multiple inputs processed biochemically before the
final output is coupled to transducing "smart-material" electrodes and other
systems. These applications have warranted recent emphasis on networking of
biocomputing gates. First few-gate networks have been experimentally realized,
including coupling, for instance, to signal-responsive electrodes for signal
readout. In order to achieve scalable, stable network design and functioning,
considerations of noise propagation and control have been initiated as a new
research direction. Optimization of single enzyme-based gates for avoiding
analog noise amplification has been explored, as were certain
network-optimization concepts. We review and exemplify these developments, as
well as offer an outlook for possible future research foci. The latter include
design and uses of non-Boolean network elements, e.g., filters, as well as
other developments motivated by potential novel sensor and biotechnology
applications.

without self-interaction and omnivory. A source of perturbation is a shift in
death rate of a trophic level, and the measure of perturbation is the
difference between the perturbed and unperturbed steady state populations. For
Lotka-Volterra food chains with linear functional response, we show
analytically that both intraspecific competition and intraguild predation can
either dampen or enhance the propagation of perturbations, thus stabilizing or
destabilizing the food web. The direction of the effect depend on the position
of the source of perturbation, as well as on the position of the additional
competitive and predatory links . These conclusions are confirmed numerically
for a food chain with more realistic Type-II functional response. Our results
support the positions of both sides in the long-standing debate on the effect
of intraspecific competition and omnivory on the stability of trophic systems.

one) of each node is updated at each time t to a state determined by the states
at time t-1 of those nodes that have links to it. When these systems are used
to model genetic control, the case of 'canalizing' update rules is of
particular interest. A canalizing rule is one for which a node state at time
$t$ is determined by the state at time t-1 of a single one of its inputs when
that inputting node is in its canalizing state. Previous work on the
order/disorder transition in Boolean networks considered complex, non-random
network topology. In the current paper we extend this previous work to account
for canalizing behavior.

that it contradicts with the basic premise of natural selection. Favoring
players with higher fitness, the latter is key for understanding the challenges
faced by cooperators when competing with defectors. Evolutionary game theory
provides a competent theoretical framework for addressing the subtleties of
cooperation in such situations, which are known as social dilemmas. Recent
advances point towards the fact that the evolution of strategies alone may be
insufficient to fully exploit the benefits offered by cooperative behavior.
Indeed, while spatial structure and heterogeneity, for example, have been
recognized as potent promoters of cooperation, coevolutionary rules can extend
the potentials of such entities further, and even more importantly, lead to the
understanding of their emergence. The introduction of coevolutionary rules to
evolutionary games implies, that besides the evolution of strategies, another
property may simultaneously be subject to evolution as well. Coevolutionary
rules may affect the interaction network, the reproduction capability of
players, their reputation, mobility or age. Here we review recent works on
evolutionary games incorporating coevolutionary rules, as well as give a
didactic description of potential pitfalls and misconceptions associated with
the subject. In addition, we briefly outline directions for future research
that we feel are promising, thereby particularly focusing on dynamical effects
of coevolutionary rules on the evolution of cooperation, which are still widely
open to research and thus hold promise of exciting new discoveries.

not just a single entropy, but a one-parameter family of entropies, there is a
single distribution maximizing all of them simultaneously.

motion. While the latter is due to the thermal motion of surrounding matter,
the cells locomotion is generally associated to their vitality. In the present
paper the concept of cell temperament is introduced, being analogous to
thermodynamic temperature and related to the cell entropy production. A
heuristic expression for the diffusion coefficient of cell on structured
surfaces is derived as well. The cell locomemory is also studied via the
generalized Langevin equation.

synthesis occurs in a selective manner. The control of transcription is the
most dominant type of regulation mediated by a complex of molecules such as
transcription factors. In general, regulatory molecules are of two types:
activator and repressor. Activators promote the initiation of transcription
whereas repressors inhibit transcription. In many cases, they regulate the gene
transcription on binding the promoter mutually exclusively and the observed
gene expression response is either graded or binary. In experiments, the gene
expression response is quantified by the amount of proteins produced on varying
the concentration of an external inducer molecules in the cell. In this paper,
we study a gene regulatory network where activators and repressors both bind
the same promoter mutually exclusively. The network is modeled by assuming that
the gene can be in three possible states: repressed, unregulated and active. An
exact analytical expression for the steady-state probability distribution of
protein levels is then derived. The exact result helps to explain the
experimental observations that in the presence of activator molecules the
response is graded at all inducer levels whereas in the presence of both
activator and repressor molecules, the response is graded at low and high
inducer levels and binary at an intermediate inducer level.

deterministic models of viability selection and recombination among n possible
haplotypes has an upper bound of 2^n - 1. Here a proof is provided. The upper
bound of 3^{n-1} obtained by Lyubich et al. (2001) using Bezout's Theorem
(1779) is reduced here to 2^n through a change of representation that reduces
the third-order polynomials to second order. A further reduction to 2^n - 1 is
obtained using the homogeneous representation of the system, which yields
always one solution `at infinity'. While the original conjecture was made for
systems of viability selection and recombination, the results here generalize
to viability selection with any arbitrary system of bi-parental transmission,
which includes recombination and mutation as special cases. An example is
constructed of a mutation-selection system that has 2^n - 1 fixed points given
any n, which shows that 2^n - 1 is the sharpest possible upper bound that can
be found for the general space of selection and transmission coefficients.

for the reversible and monodisperse self-assembly of simple icosahedral virus
capsid structures. The success and efficiency of assembly as a function of
thermodynamic and geometric factors can be qualitatively related to the
potential energy landscape structure of the assembling system. Even though the
model is strongly coarse-grained, it exhibits a number of features also
observed in experiments, such as sigmoidal assembly dynamics, hysteresis in
capsid formation and numerous kinetic traps. We also investigate the effect of
macromolecular crowding on the assembly dynamics. Crowding agents generally
reduce capsid yields at optimal conditions for non-crowded assembly, but may
increase yields for parameter regimes away from the optimum. Finally, we
generalize the model to a larger triangulation number T = 3, and observe more
complex assembly dynamics than that seen for the original T = 1 model.

susceptible hosts. Thus, the patterns of contacts or contact network of a
population fundamentally shapes the course of epidemics. While there is a
robust and growing theory for the dynamics of single epidemics in networks, we
know little about the impacts of network structure on long term epidemic or
endemic transmission. For seasonal diseases like influenza, pathogens
repeatedly return to populations with complex and changing patterns of
susceptibility and immunity acquired through prior infection. Here, we develop
two mathematical approaches for modeling consecutive seasonal outbreaks of a
partially-immunizing infection in a population with contact heterogeneity.
Using methods from percolation theory we consider both leaky immunity, where
all previously infected individuals gain partial immunity, and perfect
immunity, where a fraction of previously infected individuals are fully immune.
By restructuring the epidemiologically active portion of their host population,
such diseases limit the potential of future outbreaks. We speculate that these
dynamics can result in evolutionary pressure to increase infectiousness.

the maximum pack- ing density of spheres in three dimension. Yet, there is no
clear understanding of what is special about this value. To address this
fundamental question we investigate the effect of macromolecular crowding on
cell metabolism. We develop a cell scale flux balance model capturing the main
features of cell metabolism at different nutrient uptakes and macromolecular
densities. Using this model we show there are two metabolic regimes at low and
high nutrient uptakes. The latter regime is charac- terized by an optimal
cytoplasmatic density where the increase of reaction rates by confinement and
the decrease by diffusion slow-down balance. More important, the predicted
optimal density is in the range of the experimentally determined density of E.
coli. We conclude that cells have evolved to a cytoplasmatic density resulting
in the maximum metabolic rate given the nutrient availability and
macromolecular crowding effects and report a flux balance model accounting for
its effect.

best described as dynamics on large combinatorial energy landscapes. A concise
approximate description of dynamics is obtained by partitioning the
micro-states of the landscape into macro-states. Since most landscapes of
interest are not tractable analytically, the probabilities of transitions
between macro-states need to be extracted numerically from the microscopic
ones, typically by full enumeration of the state space. Here we propose to
approximate transition probabilities by a Markov chain Monte-Carlo method. For
landscapes of the number partitioning problem and an RNA switch molecule we
show that the method allows for accurate probability estimates with
significantly reduced computational cost.

document the prevalence of fractals at all levels of the nervous system, giving
credence to the notion of their functional relevance; and second, to draw
attention to the as yet still unresolved issues of the detailed relationships
among power law scaling, self-similarity, and self-organized criticality. As
regards criticality, I will document that it has become a pivotal reference
point in Neurodynamics. Furthermore, I will emphasize the not yet fully
appreciated significance of allometric control processes. For dynamic fractals,
I will assemble reasons for attributing to them the capacity to adapt task
execution to contextual changes across a range of scales. The final Section
consists of general reflections on the implications of the reviewed data, and
identifies what appear to be issues of fundamental importance for future
research in the rapidly evolving topic of this review.

enable researchers to observe detailed cellular reactions to experimental

state-of-the-art in analyzing perturbation screens from a network point of
view. We describe approaches to make the step from the parts list to the wiring
diagram by using phenotypes for network inference and integrating them with
complementary data sources. The first part of the review describes methods to
analyze one- or low-dimensional phenotypes like viability or reporter activity;
the second part concentrates on high-dimensional phenotypes showing global

estimating species trees and species demographics from genetic markers.
Practical applications of the multi-species coalescent model are, however,
limited by the need to integrate or sample over all gene trees possible for
each genetic marker. Here we describe a polynomial-time algorithm that computes
the likelihood of a species tree directly from the markers under a finite-sites
model of mutation, effectively integrating over all possible gene trees. The
method applies to independent (unlinked) biallelic markers such as well-spaced
single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), and we have implemented it in SNAPP, a
Markov chain Monte-Carlo sampler for inferring species trees, divergence dates,
and population sizes. We report results from simulation experiments and from an
analysis of 1997 amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) loci in 69
individuals sampled from six species of {\em Ourisia} (New Zealand native
foxglove).

cells, including energy transduction and building block biosynthesis. While
these are the best characterized networks in living systems, understanding
their evolutionary history and complex wiring constitutes one of the most
fascinating open questions in biology, intimately related to the enigma of
life's origin itself. Is the evolution of metabolism subject to general
principles, beyond the unpredictable accumulation of multiple historical
accidents? Here we search for such principles by applying to an artificial
chemical universe some of the methodologies developed for the study of genome
scale models of cellular metabolism. In particular, we use metabolic flux
constraint-based models to exhaustively search for artificial chemistry
pathways that can optimally perform an array of elementary metabolic functions.
Despite the simplicity of the model employed, we find that the ensuing pathways
display a surprisingly rich set of properties, including the existence of
autocatalytic cycles and hierarchical modules, the appearance of universally
preferable metabolites and reactions, and a logarithmic trend of pathway length
as a function of input/output molecule size. Some of these properties can be
derived analytically, borrowing methods previously used in cryptography. In
addition, by mapping biochemical networks onto a simplified carbon atom
reaction backbone, we find that several of the properties predicted by the
artificial chemistry model hold for real metabolic networks. These findings
suggest that optimality principles and arithmetic simplicity might lie beneath
some aspects of biochemical complexity.

So far, theoretical explanations for body-size patterns in periodic
population dynamics have received little attention. In particular, tuning and
testing of allometric models on empirical data and regressions has not been
carried out yet. Here, oscillations expected from a one-species (delayed
logistic) and a two-species (Rosenzweig-MacArthur) model were compared to
cycles observed in laboratory experiments and field surveys for a wide range of
invertebrates and vertebrates. The parameters in the equations were linked to
body mass, using a consistent set of allometric relationships that was
calibrated on 230 regressions. Oscillation period and amplitude predicted by
the models were validated with data taken from literature. Results. The
collected data showed that cycle times of herbivores scaled to species body
mass with a slope up to 1/4 as expected from the models. With exception of
aquatic herbi-detritivores, intercepts were observed at the level calculated by
the two-species model. Remarkably, oscillation periods were size-independent
for predatory invertebrates, fishes, birds and mammals. Average cycles were of
4 to 5 years, similar to those predicted by the one-species model with a
size-independent delay of 1 year. The consistent difference between herbivores
and the carnivores could be explained by the models from the small parameter
space for consumer-resource cycles in generalist predators. As expected,
amplitudes recorded in the field did not scale to size. Observed oscillation
periods were generally within a factor of about 2 from the values expected from
the models. This demonstrates that a set of slopes and intercepts for age and
density parameters applicable to a wide range of species allows a reasonable
estimate of independently measured cycle times.

examined the folding of the non-repetitive sequence of von Willebrand factor
vWF-C1 domain (67 amino acids) and PGM 2X (242 amino acids) at neutral and low
pH using Discrete Molecular Dynamics. A four-bead protein model with hydrogen
bonding and amino acid-specific hydrophobic/hydrophilic and electrostatic
interactions of side chains) was used. The simulations reveal that the distant
N- and C-terminal regions form salt-bridges at neutral pH giving a relatively
compact folded structure. At low pH, the salt bridges break giving a more open
and extended structure. The calculated average value of the beta-strand
increases from 0.23 at neutral pH to 0.36 at low pH in very good agreement with
CD data. Simulations of vWF C1 show 4-6 beta strands separated by turns/loops
and we found that pH did not affect significantly the folded structure. The
average beta-strand structure of 0.32 was again in very good agreement with the
CD results.

protein-protein interaction networks. Date hubs display low co-expression with
their partners, whilst party hubs have high co-expression. It was proposed that
party hubs are local coordinators whereas date hubs are global connectors. Here
we show that the reported importance of date hubs to network connectivity can
in fact be attributed to a tiny subset of them. Crucially, these few, extremely
central, hubs do not display particularly low expression correlation,
undermining the idea of a link between this quantity and hub function. The
date/party distinction was originally motivated by an approximately bimodal
distribution of hub co-expression; we show that this feature is not always
robust to methodological changes. Additionally, topological properties of hubs
do not in general correlate with co-expression. Thus, we suggest that a
date/party dichotomy is not meaningful and it might be more useful to conceive
of roles for protein-protein interactions rather than individual proteins. We
find significant correlations between interaction centrality and the functional
similarity of the interacting proteins.

sciences and beyond. For many important problems several different models or
hypotheses exist and choosing which one best describes reality or observed data
is not straightforward. We therefore require suitable statistical tools that
allow us to choose rationally between different mechanistic models of e.g.
signal transduction or gene regulation networks. This is particularly
challenging in systems biology where only a small number of molecular species
can be assayed at any given time and all measurements are subject to
measurement uncertainty. Here we develop such a model selection framework based
on approximate Bayesian computation and employing sequential Monte Carlo
sampling. We show that our approach can be applied across a wide range of
biological scenarios, and we illustrate its use on real data describing
influenza dynamics and the JAK-STAT signalling pathway. Bayesian model
selection strikes a balance between the complexity of the simulation models and
their ability to describe observed data. The present approach enables us to
employ the whole formal apparatus to any system that can be (efficiently)
simulated, even when exact likelihoods are computationally intractable.

cascade of biochemical reactions (initiation, ribosome assembly, elongation,
etc.), the rate of which can be regulated by small non-coding microRNAs through
multiple mechanisms. It remains unclear what mechanisms of microRNA action are
most dominant: moreover, many experimental reports deliver controversal
messages on what is the concrete mechanism actually observed in the experiment.
Parker and Nissan (Parker and Nissan, RNA, 2008) demonstrated that it is
impossible to distinguish alternative biological hypotheses using the steady
state data on the rate of protein synthesis. For their analysis they used two
simple kinetic models of protein translation. In contrary, we show that
dynamical data allow to discriminate some of the mechanisms of microRNA action.
We demonstrate this using the same models as in (Parker and Nissan, RNA, 2008)
for the sake of comparison but the methods developed (asymptotology of
biochemical networks) can be used for other models. As one of the results of
our analysis, we formulate a hypothesis that the effect of microRNA action is
measurable and observable only if it affects the dominant system
(generalization of the limiting step notion for complex networks) of the
protein translation machinery. The dominant system can vary in different
experimental conditions that can partially explain the existing controversy of
some of the experimental data.

use it to study macro-scale properties of axonal transport, the process by
which intracellular cargo is moved in the axons of neurons. By directly
modeling the smallest scale interactions, we can use recent microscopic
experimental observations to infer all the parameters of the model. Then, using
techniques from probability theory, we compute asymptotic limits of the
stochastic behavior of individual motor-cargo complexes, while also
characterizing both equilibrium and non-equilibrium ensemble behavior. We use
these results in order to investigate three important biological questions: (1)
How homogeneous are axons at stochastic equilibrium? (2) How quickly can axons
return to stochastic equilibrium after large local perturbations? (3) How is
our understanding of delivery time to a depleted target region changed by
taking the whole cell point-of-view?

extinction are all possible, similar to what happens to living organisms. Using
this similarity it is possible, in principle, to build family trees which show
the degree of relatedness between languages.
  The method used by modern glottochronology, developed by Swadesh in the
1950s, measures distances from the percentage of words with a common historical
origin. The weak point of this method is that subjective judgment plays a
relevant role.
  Recently we proposed an automated method that avoids the subjectivity, whose
results can be replicated by studies that use the same database and that
doesn't require a specific linguistic knowledge. Moreover, the method allows a
quick comparison of a large number of languages.
  We applied our method to the Indo-European and Austronesian families,
considering in both cases, fifty different languages. The resulting trees are
similar to those of previous studies, but with some important differences in
the position of few languages and subgroups. We believe that these differences
carry new information on the structure of the tree and on the phylogenetic
relationships within families.

that depend on the intrinsic dynamics of each neuron, the input they receive
and on the connections between neurons. In this article we study the Markovian
nature of the sequence of spike times in stochastic neural networks, and in
particular the ability to deduce from a spike train the next spike time, and
therefore produce a description of the network activity only based on the spike
times regardless of the membrane potential process.
  To study this question in a rigorous manner, we introduce and study an
event-based description of networks of noisy integrate-and-fire neurons, i.e.
that is based on the computation of the spike times. We show that the firing
times of the neurons in the networks constitute a Markov chain, whose
transition probability is related to the probability distribution of the
interspike interval of the neurons in the network. In the cases where the
Markovian model can be developed, the transition probability is explicitly
derived in such classical cases of neural networks as the linear
integrate-and-fire neuron models with excitatory and inhibitory interactions,
for different types of synapses, possibly featuring noisy synaptic integration,
transmission delays and absolute and relative refractory period. This covers
most of the cases that have been investigated in the event-based description of
spiking deterministic neural networks.

Often, we are interested in complexity trends of these system as it evolves
under some dynamic. An example might be looking at the complexity of a food web
as species enter an ecosystem via migration or speciation, and leave via
extinction.
  In a previous paper, a complexity measure of networks was proposed based on
the {\em complexity is information content} paradigm. To apply this paradigm to
any object, one must fix two things: a representation language, in which
strings of symbols from some alphabet describe, or stand for the objects being
considered; and a means of determining when two such descriptions refer to the
same object. With these two things set, the information content of an object
can be computed in principle from the number of equivalent descriptions
describing a particular object.
  The previously proposed representation language had the deficiency that the
fully connected and empty networks were the most complex for a given number of
nodes. A variation of this measure, called zcomplexity, applied a compression
algorithm to the resulting bitstring representation, to solve this problem.
Unfortunately, zcomplexity proved too computationally expensive to be
practical.
  In this paper, I propose a new representation language that encodes the
number of links along with the number of nodes and a representation of the
linklist. This, like zcomplexity, exhibits minimal complexity for fully
connected and empty networks, but is as tractable as the original measure.

environmental perturbations as if of one mind. Most studies in collective
animal behaviour have aimed to understand how a globally ordered state may
emerge from simple behavioural rules. Less effort has been devoted to
understanding the origin of collective response, namely the way the group as a
whole reacts to its environment. Yet collective response is the adaptive key to
survivor, especially when strong predatory pressure is present. Here we argue
that collective response in animal groups is achieved through scale-free
behavioural correlations. By reconstructing the three-dimensional position and
velocity of individual birds in large flocks of starlings, we measured to what
extent the velocity fluctuations of different birds are correlated to each
other. We found that the range of such spatial correlation does not have a
constant value, but it scales with the linear size of the flock. This result
indicates that behavioural correlations are scale-free: the change in the
behavioural state of one animal affects and is affected by that of all other
animals in the group, no matter how large the group is. Scale-free correlations
extend maximally the effective perception range of the individuals, thus
compensating for the short-range nature of the direct inter-individual
interaction and enhancing global response to perturbations. Our results suggest
that flocks behave as critical systems, poised to respond maximally to
environmental perturbations.

response to a number of stresses like attacks by pests or pathogens and
wounding by animals. Some recent experiments provide significant new knowledge
on the molecular detail and connectivity of the pathway. The pathway has two
major components in the form of feedback loops, one negative and the other
positive. We construct a minimal mathematical model, incorporating the feedback
loops, to study the dynamics of the JA signaling pathway. The model exhibits
transient gene expression activity in the form of JA pulses in agreement with
experimental observations. The dependence of the pulse amplitude, duration and
peak time on the key parameters of the model is determined computationally. The
deterministic and stochastic aspects of the pathway dynamics are investigated
using both the full mathematical model as well as a reduced version of it. We
also compare the mechanism of pulse formation with the known mechanisms of
pulse generation in some bacterial and viral systems.

3(10) and Pi-helices revealed that these could be best described by gamma and
exponential distributions, across structural classes. Comparative study of
normalized percentage of non-glycine and non-proline residues in 3(10), Pi and
alpha-helices revealed a considerably higher proportion of 3(10) and Pi-helix
residues in disallowed, generous and allowed regions of Ramachandran map. Probe
into these findings in the light of evolution suggested clearly that 3(10) and
Pi-helices should appropriately be viewed as evolutionary intermediates on long
time scale, for not only the {\alpha}-helical conformation but also for the
'turns', equiprobably. Hence, accidental and random nature of occurrences of
3(10) and Pi-helices, and their evolutionary non-conservation, could be
described and explained from an invariant quantitative framework. Extent of
correctness of two previously proposed hypotheses on 3(10) and Pi-helices, have
been investigated too. Alongside these, a new algorithm to differentiate
between related sequences is proposed, which reliably studies evolutionary
distance with respect to protein secondary structures.

surrounding tissue, taking into account also the interplay with diffusible
nutrients feeding the cells. Models specialize in nonlinear systems of possibly
degenerate parabolic equations, which include phenomenological terms related to
specific cell functions. The paper discusses general modeling guidelines for
such terms, as well as for initial and boundary conditions, aiming at both
biological consistency and mathematical robustness of the resulting problems.
Particularly, it addresses some qualitative properties such as a priori
nonnegativity, boundedness, and uniqueness of the solutions. Existence of the
solutions is studied in the one-dimensional time-independent case.

Two of them (sensory neurons or sensors) are stimulated by noise and periodic
signals with different ratio of frequencies, and the third one (interneuron)
receives the output of these two sensors and noise. We propose the analytical
approach to analysis of Interspike Intervals (ISI) statistics of the spike
train generated by the interneuron. The ISI distributions of the sensory
neurons are considered to be known. The frequencies of the input sinusoidal
signals are in ratios, which are usual for music. We show that in the case of
small integer ratios (musical consonance) the input pair of sinusoids results
in the ISI distribution appropriate for more regular output spike train than in
a case of large integer ratios (musical dissonance) of input frequencies. These
effects are explained from the viewpoint of the proposed theory.

directional selection towards an optimum RNA structure. We find that the
punctuated equilibria lead to a very slow approach to the optimum, following on
average an inverse power of the evolutionary time. In addition, our study of
the trajectories shows that the out-of-equilibrium effects due to the
evolutionary process are very weak. In particular, the distribution of
genotypes is close to that arising during equilibrium stabilizing selection. As
a consequence, the evolutionary dynamics leave almost no measurable
out-of-equilibrium trace, only the transition genotypes (close to the border
between different periods of stasis) have atypical mutational properties.

population size. For a population with a time-variable carrying capacity we
have computed the distributions of the total branch lengths of its sample
genealogies. Within the coalescent approximation we have obtained a general
expression, Eq. (27), for the moments of these distributions for an arbitrary
smooth dependence of the population size on time. We investigate how the
frequency of population-size variations alters the distributions. This allows
us to discuss their influence on the distribution of the number of mutations,
and on the population homozygosity in populations with variable size.

(EET) in a network model of the Fenna-Matthews-Olson (FMO) complex, a
biological pigment-protein complex involved in the early steps of
photosynthesis in sulphur bacteria. The influence of Markovian, as well as
spatially and temporally correlated (non-Markovian) noise on the generation of
entanglement across distinct chromophores (site entanglement) and different
excitonic eigenstates (mode entanglement) is studied for different injection
mechanisms, including thermal and coherent laser excitation. Additionally, we
study the entangling power of the FMO complex under natural operating
conditions. While quantum information processing tends to favor maximal
entanglement, near unit EET is achieved as the result of an intricate interplay
between coherent and noisy processes where the initial part of the evolution
displays intermediate values of both forms of entanglement.

is the possibility for mutants to fixate (take over) an entire population.
Here, we generalize a recent WKB-based theory to study fixation in evolutionary
games under non-vanishing selection, and investigate the relation between
selection intensity w and demographic (random) fluctuations. This allows the
accurate treatment of large fluctuations and yields the probability and mean
times of fixation beyond the weak selection limit. The power of the theory is
demonstrated on prototypical models of cooperation dilemmas with multiple
absorbing states. Our predictions compare excellently with numerical
simulations and, for finite w, significantly improve over those of the
Fokker-Planck approximation.

evolution of complex networks. However, the development of a method, which is
both fast and accurate, provides modular overlaps and partitions of a
heterogeneous network, has proven to be rather difficult. Methodology/Principal
Findings: Here we introduce the novel concept of ModuLand, an integrative
method family determining overlapping network modules as hills of an influence
function-based, centrality-type community landscape, and including several
widely used modularization methods as special cases. As various adaptations of
the method family, we developed several algorithms, which provide an efficient
analysis of weighted and directed networks, and (1) determine pervasively
overlapping modules with high resolution; (2) uncover a detailed hierarchical
network structure allowing an efficient, zoom-in analysis of large networks;
(3) allow the determination of key network nodes and (4) help to predict
network dynamics. Conclusions/Significance: The concept opens a wide range of
possibilities to develop new approaches and applications including network
routing, classification, comparison and prediction.

works of neurons and glia in culture imaged by fluorescence optical microscopy
in order to map functional calcium signaling with single pixel resolution.
Optical flow estimates the direction and speed of motion of objects in an image
between subsequent frames in a recorded digital sequence of images (i.e. a
movie). Computed vector field outputs by the algorithm were able to track the
spatiotemporal dynamics of calcium signaling pat- terns. We begin by briefly
reviewing the mathematics of the optical flow algorithm, and then describe how
to solve for the displacement vectors and how to measure their reliability. We
then compare computed flow vectors with manually estimated vectors for the
progression of a calcium signal recorded from representative astrocyte
cultures. Finally, we applied the algorithm to preparations of primary
astrocytes and hippocampal neurons and to the rMC-1 Muller glial cell line in
order to illustrate the capability of the algorithm for capturing different
types of spatiotemporal calcium activity. We discuss the imaging requirements,
parameter selection and threshold selection for reliable measurements, and
offer perspectives on uses of the vector data.

association of fast parallel matrix multiplication algorithms has yielded
astounding results and insights. In this discourse, we use the tools of
molecular biology to demonstrate the theoretical encoding of Strassen's fast
matrix multiplication algorithm with DNA based on an $n$-moduli set in the
residue number system, thereby demonstrating the viability of computational
mathematics with DNA. As a result, a general scalable implementation of this
model in the DNA computing paradigm is presented and can be generalized to the
application of \emph{all} fast matrix multiplication algorithms on a DNA
computer. We also discuss the practical capabilities and issues of this
scalable implementation. Fast methods of matrix computations with DNA are
important because they also allow for the efficient implementation of other
algorithms (i.e. inversion, computing determinants, and graph theory) with DNA.

for the formulation of epidemic models. Whether they are external and
seasonally driven, or arise from the intrinsic dynamics is an open problem. It
is known that fixed time delays destabilize the steady state solution of the
standard SIRS model, giving rise to stable oscillations for certain parameters
values. In this contribution, starting from the classical SIRS model, we make a
general treatment of the recovery and loss of immunity terms. We present
oscillation diagrams (amplitude and period) in terms of the parameters of the
model, showing how oscillations can be destabilized by the shape of the
distributions of the two characteristic (infectious and immune) times. The
formulation is made in terms of delay equation which are both numerical
integrated and linearized. Results from simulation are included showing where
they support the linear analysis and explaining why not where they do not.
Considerations and comparison with real diseases are presented along.

physiological processes. A key component of extrinsically activated apoptosis
is the death receptor Fas, which, on binding to its cognate ligand FasL,
oligomerize to form the death-inducing signaling complex. Motivated by recent
experimental data, we propose a mathematical model of death ligand-receptor
dynamics where FasL acts as a clustering agent for Fas, which form locally
stable signaling platforms through proximity-induced receptor interactions.
Significantly, the model exhibits hysteresis, providing an upstream mechanism
for bistability and robustness. At low receptor concentrations, the bistability
is contingent on the trimerism of FasL. Moreover, irreversible bistability,
representing a committed cell death decision, emerges at high concentrations,
which may be achieved through receptor pre-association or localization onto
membrane lipid rafts. Thus, our model provides a novel theory for these
observed biological phenomena within the unified context of bistability.
Importantly, as Fas interactions initiate the extrinsic apoptotic pathway, our
model also suggests a mechanism by which cells may function as bistable
life/death switches independently of any such dynamics in their downstream
components. Our results highlight the role of death receptors in deciding cell
fate and add to the signal processing capabilities attributed to receptor
clustering.

world. Though the emerging data from these studies are illuminating, their
reconciliation with epidemiologic and clinical observations poses a major
challenge. In the current study, we provide a novel mathematical model that
begins to address this challenge. We model tumors as a discrete time branching
process that starts with a single driver mutation and proceeds as each new
driver mutation leads to a slightly increased rate of clonal expansion. Using
the model, we observe tremendous variation in the rate of tumor development -
providing an understanding of the heterogeneity in tumor sizes and development
times that have been observed by epidemiologists and clinicians. Furthermore,
the model provides a simple formula for the number of driver mutations as a
function of the total number of mutations in the tumor. Finally, when applied
to recent experimental data, the model allows us to calculate, for the first
time, the actual selective advantage provided by typical somatic mutations in
human tumors in situ. This selective advantage is surprisingly small, 0.005 +-
0.0005, and has major implications for experimental cancer research.

neurons are quickly gaining popularity. While the raw data are fluorescence
movies, the underlying spike trains are of interest. This work presents a fast
non-negative deconvolution filter to infer the approximately most likely spike
train for each neuron, given the fluorescence observations. This algorithm
outperforms optimal linear deconvolution (Wiener filtering) on both simulated
and biological data. The performance gains come from restricting the inferred
spike trains to be positive (using an interior-point method), unlike the Wiener
filter. The algorithm is fast enough that even when imaging over 100 neurons,
inference can be performed on the set of all observed traces faster than
real-time. Performing optimal spatial filtering on the images further refines
the estimates. Importantly, all the parameters required to perform the
inference can be estimated using only the fluorescence data, obviating the need
to perform joint electrophysiological and imaging calibration experiments.

are derived from the physical properties of the brain. To address the question
of whether the mind supervenes on the brain, we frame a supervenience
hypothesis in rigorous statistical terms. Specifically, we propose a modified
version of supervenience (called epsilon-supervenience) that is amenable to
experimental investigation and statistical analysis. To illustrate this
approach, we perform a thought experiment that illustrates how the
probabilistic theory of pattern recognition can be used to make a one-sided
determination of epsilon-supervenience. The physical property of the brain
employed in this analysis is the graph describing brain connectivity (i.e., the
brain-graph or connectome). epsilon-supervenience allows us to determine
whether a particular mental property can be inferred from one's connectome to
within any given positive misclassification rate, regardless of the
relationship between the two. This may provide motivation for
cross-disciplinary research between neuroscientists and statisticians.

systems given by a system of ordinary delay differential equations by a Boolean
network model. Often Boolean models are much simpler to understand than complex
differential equations models. The motivation for this work comes from
mathematical systems biology. While Boolean mechanisms do not provide
information about exact concentration rates or time scales, they are often
sufficient to capture steady states and other key dynamics. Due to their
intuitive nature, such models are very appealing to researchers in the life
sciences. This paper is focused on dynamical systems that exhibit bistability
and are desc ribedby delay equations. It is shown that if a certain motif
including a feedback loop is present in the wiring diagram of the system, the
Boolean model captures the bistability of molecular switches. The method is
appl ied to two examples from biology, the lac operon and the phage lambda
lysis/lysogeny switch.

structure of the full length (FL) potassium channel protein, FL-KcsA, in its
closed conformation, and the electronic structure of the ClC chloride channel.
The results indicate that both ion channels are strongly polarized towards the
extracellular region with respect to the membrane mean plane. FL-KcsA possesses
an electric dipole moment of magnitude 403 Debye while ClC has a macrodipole
whose magnitude is about five times larger, 1983 Debye, thereby contributing to
differentiate their membrane electric barriers. The dipole vectors of both
proteins are aligned along the corresponding selectivity filters. This result
suggests that potassium and chloride ion channels are not passive with respect
to the movement of ions across the membrane and the ionic motion might be
partially driven by the electric field of the protein in conjunction with the
electrochemical potential of the membrane.

cargo particle along a microtubule-like track on a planar substrate by several
kinesin-like processive motors. Our newly developed adhesive motor dynamics
algorithm combines the numerical integration of a Langevin equation for the
motion of a sphere with kinetic rules for the molecular motors. The Langevin
part includes diffusive motion, the action of the pulling motors, and
hydrodynamic interactions between sphere and wall. The kinetic rules for the
motors include binding to and unbinding from the filament as well as active
motor steps. We find that the simulated mean transport length increases
exponentially with the number of bound motors, in good agreement with earlier
results. The number of motors in binding range to the motor track fluctuates in
time with a Poissonian distribution, both for springs and cables being used as
models for the linker mechanics. Cooperativity in the sense of equal load
sharing only occurs for high values for viscosity and attachment time.

range expansions, building on recent results in [Hallatschek et al., Proc.\

population of two fluorescently labeled microbial species is grown in a
circular geometry. As the population expands, a coarsening process driven by
genetic drift gives rise to sectoring patterns with fractal boundaries, which
show a non-trivial asymptotic distribution. Using simplified lattice based
Monte Carlo simulations as a generic caricature of the above experiment, we
present detailed numerical results to establish a model for sector boundaries
as time changed Brownian motions. This is used to derive a general one-to-one
mapping of sector statistics between circular and linear geometries, which
leads to a full understanding of the sectoring patterns in terms of
annihilating diffusions.

driven by the host immune response and by selective pressures exerted through
drug treatment. To understand and model the evolution of HIV quantitatively,
the parameters governing genetic diversification and the strength of selection
need to be known. While mutation rates can be measured in single replication
cycles, the relevant effective recombination rate depends on the probability of
coinfection of a cell with more than one virus and can only be inferred from
population data. However, most population genetic estimators for recombination
rates assume absence of selection and are hence of limited applicability to
HIV, since positive and purifying selection are important in HIV evolution.
Here, we estimate the rate of recombination and the distribution of selection
coefficients from time-resolved sequence data tracking the evolution of HIV
within single patients. By examining temporal changes in the genetic
composition of the population, we estimate the effective recombination to be
r=1.4e-5 recombinations per site and generation. Furthermore, we provide
evidence that selection coefficients of at least 15% of the observed
non-synonymous polymorphisms exceed 0.8% per generation. These results provide
a basis for a more detailed understanding of the evolution of HIV. A
particularly interesting case is evolution in response to drug treatment, where
recombination can facilitate the rapid acquisition of multiple resistance
mutations. With the methods developed here, more precise and more detailed
studies will be possible, as soon as data with higher time resolution and
greater sample sizes is available.

  Reconstruction</title><categories>math.PR cs.DS math.ST q-bio.PE q-bio.QM stat.TH</categories><license>http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/</license><abstract>  Molecular phylogenetic techniques do not generally account for such common
evolutionary events as site insertions and deletions (known as indels). Instead
tree building algorithms and ancestral state inference procedures typically
rely on substitution-only models of sequence evolution. In practice these
methods are extended beyond this simplified setting with the use of heuristics
that produce global alignments of the input sequences--an important problem
which has no rigorous model-based solution. In this paper we consider a new
version of the multiple sequence alignment in the context of stochastic indel
models. More precisely, we introduce the following {\em trace reconstruction
problem on a tree} (TRPT): a binary sequence is broadcast through a tree
channel where we allow substitutions, deletions, and insertions; we seek to
reconstruct the original sequence from the sequences received at the leaves of
the tree. We give a recursive procedure for this problem with strong
reconstruction guarantees at low mutation rates, providing also an alignment of
the sequences at the leaves of the tree. The TRPT problem without indels has
been studied in previous work (Mossel 2004, Daskalakis et al. 2006) as a
bootstrapping step towards obtaining optimal phylogenetic reconstruction
methods. The present work sets up a framework for extending these works to
evolutionary models with indels.

conditions and long-term changes in fish populations adds to the need to
understand the effects of stochastic forcing on marine populations. Cohort
resonance is of particular interest because it involves selective sensitivity
to specific time scales of environmental variability, including that of mean
age of reproduction, and, more importantly, very low frequencies (i.e.,
trends). We present an age-structured model for two Pacific salmon species with
environmental variability in survival rate and in individual growth rate, hence
spawning age distribution. We use computed frequency response curves and
analysis of the linearized dynamics to obtain two main results. First, the
frequency response of the population is affected by the life history stage at
which variability affects the population; varying growth rate tends to excite
periodic resonance in age structure, while varying survival tends to excite
low-frequency fluctuation with more effect on total population size. Second,
decreasing adult survival strengthens the cohort resonance effect at all
frequencies, a finding that addresses the question of how fishing and climate
change will interact.

allowing for the actuation of a gas-liquid interface and of the neighboring
fluid. A first way to control the interface motion is to apply a pressure
difference across it. In this case, the efficiency of three different
micro-geometries at anchoring the interface is compared. Also, the critical
pressures needed to move the interface are measured and compared to theoretical
result. A second way to control the interface motion is by ultrasonic
excitation. When the excitation is weak, the interface exhibits traveling
waves, which follow a dispersion equation. At stronger ultrasonic levels,
standing waves appear on the interface, with frequencies that are half integer
multiple of the excitation frequency. An associated microstreaming flow field
observed in the vicinity of the interface is characterized. The meniscus and
associated streaming flow have the potential to transport particles and mix
reagents.

specifically protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks. First, we find that
given similar conditions (i.e. number of nodes, number of links, degree
distribution and clustering), fewer colors are needed to color disassortative
(high degree nodes tend to connect to low degree nodes and vice versa) than
assortative networks. Fewer colors create fewer independent sets which in turn
imply higher concurrency potential for a network. Since PPI networks tend to be
disassortative, we suggest that in addition to functional specificity and
stability proposed previously by Maslov and Sneppen (Science 296, 2002), the
disassortative nature of PPI networks may promote the ability of cells to
perform multiple, crucial and functionally diverse tasks concurrently. Second,
since graph coloring is closely related to the presence of cliques in a graph,
the significance of node coloring information to the problem of identifying
protein complexes, i.e. dense subgraphs in a PPI network, is investigated. We
find that for PPI networks where 1% to 11% of nodes participate in at least one
identified protein complex, such as H. sapien (DIP20070219, DIP20081014 and
HPRD070609), DSATUR (a well-known complete graph coloring algorithm) node
coloring information can improve the quality (homogeneity and separation) of
initial candidate complexes. This finding may help to improve existing protein
complex detection methods, and/or suggest new methods.

of information required to build a given physical structure through
self-assembly. Our procedure can be adapted to any given geometry, and thus to
any given type of physical system. We illustrate our approach using
self-assembling polyominoes, and demonstrate the breadth of its potential
applications by quantifying the physical complexity of molecules and protein
complexes. This measure is particularly well suited for the detection of
symmetry and modularity in the underlying structure, and allows for a
quantitative definition of structural modularity. Furthermore we use our
approach to show that symmetric and modular structures are favoured in
biological self-assembly, for example of protein complexes. Lastly, we also
introduce the notions of joint, mutual and conditional complexity, which
provide a useful distance measure between physical structures.

models based on the Asymmetric Simple Exclusion Process (ASEP), which considers
hopping particles (the ribosomes) on a lattice (the polynucleotide chain). In
this work we extend this class of models and consider the two fundamental steps
of the ribosome's biochemical cycle following a coarse-grained perspective. In
order to achieve a better understanding of the underlying biological processes
and compare the theoretical predictions with experimental results, we provide a
description lying between the minimal ASEP-like models and the more detailed
models, which are analytically hard to treat. We use a mean-field approach to
study the dynamics of particles associated with an internal stepping cycle. In
this framework it is possible to characterize analytically different phases of
the system (high density, low density or maximal current phase). Crucially, we
show that the transitions between these different phases occur at different
parameter values than the equivalent transitions in a standard ASEP, indicating
the importance of including the two fundamental steps of the ribosome's
biochemical cycle into the model.

spontaneously by neural circuits and responses driven by external stimuli.
Using mean-field analysis, we ask how a neural network that intrinsically
generates chaotic patterns of activity can remain sensitive to extrinsic input.
We find that inputs not only drive network responses, they also actively
suppress ongoing activity, ultimately leading to a phase transition in which
chaos is completely eliminated. The critical input intensity at the phase
transition is a non-monotonic function of stimulus frequency, revealing a
"resonant" frequency at which the input is most effective at suppressing chaos
even though the power spectrum of the spontaneous activity peaks at zero and
falls exponentially. A prediction of our analysis is that the variance of
neural responses should be most strongly suppressed at frequencies matching the
range over which many sensory systems operate.

studied using computer simulation. Although divalent counterions cannot
condense free DNA molecules in solution, we show that if DNA configurational
entropy is restricted, divalent counterions can cause DNA reentrant
condensation similar to that caused by tri- or tetra-valent counterions.
DNA-DNA interaction is strongly repulsive at small or large counterion
concentration and is negligible or slightly attractive for a concentration in
between. Implications of our results to experiments of DNA ejection from
bacteriophages are discussed. The quantitative result serves to understand
electrostatic effects in other experiments involving DNA and divalent
counterions.

its source is a subject of active debate. Response variability (Mast and
Victor, 1991; Arieli et al., 1995 &amp; 1996; Anderson et al., 2000 &amp; 2001; Kenet
et al., 2003; Petersen et al., 2003a &amp; b; Fiser, Chiu and Weliky, 2004; MacLean
et al., 2005; Yuste et al., 2005; Vincent et al., 2007) is often treated as
random noise, generated either by other brain areas, or by stochastic processes
within the circuitry being studied. We call such sources of variability
external to stress the independence of this form of noise from activity driven
by the stimulus. Variability can also be generated internally by the same
network dynamics that generates responses to a stimulus. How can we distinguish
between external and internal sources of response variability? Here we show
that internal sources of variability interact nonlinearly with stimulus-induced
activity, and this interaction yields a suppression of noise in the evoked
state. This provides a theoretical basis and potential mechanism for the
experimental observation that, in many brain areas, stimuli cause significant
suppression of neuronal variability (Werner and Mountcastle, 1963; Fortier,
Smith and Kalaska, 1993; Anderson et al., 2000; Friedrich and Laurent, 2004;
Churchland et al., 2006; Finn, Priebe and Ferster, 2007; Mitchell, Sundberg and
Reynolds, 2007; Churchland et al., 2009). The combined theoretical and
experimental results suggest that internally generated activity is a
significant contributor to response variability in neural circuits.

strong variations in protein copy numbers due to inherently stochastic events

variations in enzyme abundance affect the collective kinetics of metabolic
reactions observed within a population of cells. Kinetic parameters measured at
the cell population level are shown to be systematically deviated from those of
single cells, even within populations of homogeneous parameters. Because of
these considerations, Michaelis-Menten kinetics can even be inappropriate to
apply at the population level. Our findings elucidate a novel origin of
discrepancy between in vivo and in vitro kinetics, and offer potential utility
for analysis of single-cell metabolomic data.

statistical properties of a two-state trajectory is the aim from many
experiments in biophysics and chemistry, such as, ion channel recordings,
enzymatic activity and structural dynamics of bio-molecules. Doing so is almost
always impossible, as the mapping of a KS into a two-state trajectory leads to
the loss of information about the KS (almost always). Here, we present the
optimal way to solve this problem. It is based on unique forms of reduced
dimensions (RD). RD forms are on-off networks with connections only between
substates of different states, where the connections can have multi-exponential
waiting time probability density functions (WT-PDFs). A RD form has the
simplest toplogy that can reproduce a given data. In theory, only a single RD
form can be constructed from the full data (hence its uniqueness), still this
task is not easy when dealing with finite data. For doing so, a toolbox made of
known statistical methods in data analysis and new statistical methods and
numerical algorithms develped for this problem is presented. Our toolbox is
self-contained: it builds a mechanism based only on the information it extracts
from the data. The implementation of the toolbox on the data is fast. The
toolbox is automated and is available for academic research upon electronic
request.

package genomic DNA into the tight confines of a cell nucleus. A fundamental
repeating unit of chromatin is the nucleosome, an octamer of histone proteins
around which 147 base pairs of DNA are wound in almost two turns of a
left-handed superhelix. Chromatin is a dynamic structure which exerts profound
influence on regulation of gene expression and other cellular functions. These
chromatin-directed processes are facilitated by optimizing nucleosome positions
throughout the genome and by remodeling nucleosomes in response to various
external and internal signals such as environmental perturbations. Here we
discuss large-scale maps of nucleosome positions made available through recent
advances in parallel high-throughput sequencing and microarray technologies. We
show that these maps reveal common features of nucleosome organization in
eukaryotic genomes. We also survey computational models designed to predict
nucleosome formation scores or energies, and demonstrate how these predictions
can be used to position multiple nucleosome on the genome without steric
overlap.

single neurons and ion channel populations to stimuli slows down as the length
of stimulation increases; in fact, no upper bound on temporal time-scales seems
to exist in such systems. Furthermore, patch clamp experiments on single ion
channels have hinted at the existence of large, mostly unobservable,
inactivation state spaces within a single ion channel. This raises the question
of the relation between this multitude of inactivation states and the observed
behavior. In this work we propose a minimal model for ion channel dynamics
which does not assume any specific structure of the inactivation state space.
The model is simple enough to render an analytical study possible. This leads
to a clear and concise explanation of the experimentally observed exponential
history-dependent relaxation in sodium channels in a voltage clamp setting, and
shows that their recovery rate from slow inactivation must be voltage
dependent. Furthermore, we predict that history-dependent relaxation cannot be
created by overly sparse spiking activity. While the model was created with ion
channel populations in mind, its simplicity and genericalness render it a good
starting point for modeling similar effects in other systems, and for scaling
up to higher levels such as single neurons which are also known to exhibit
multiple time scales.

considerable impact on public health and economic wealth. The large variability
in spatio-temporal patterns of epidemics prohibits simple interventions and
demands for a detailed analysis of each epidemic with respect to its infectious
agent and the corresponding routes of transmission. To facilitate this
analysis, a mathematical framework is introduced which links epidemic patterns
to the topology and dynamics of the underlying transmission network. The
evolution both in disease prevalence and transmission network topology are
derived from a closed set of partial differential equations for infections
without recovery which are in excellent agreement with complementarily
conducted agent based simulations. The mutual influence between the epidemic
process and its transmission network is shown by several case studies on HIV
epidemics in synthetic populations. They reveal context dependent key processes
which drive the epidemic and which in turn can be exploited for targeted
intervention strategies. The mathematical framework provides a capable toolbox
to analyze epidemics from first principles. This allows for fast in silico
modeling - and manipulation - of epidemics which is especially powerful if
complemented with adequate empirical data for parametrization.

ordered in such a way that all 1's on each row are consecutive. A Minimal
Conflicting Set is a set of rows that does not have the C1P, but every proper
subset has the C1P. Such submatrices have been considered in comparative
genomics applications, but very little is known about their combinatorial
structure and efficient algorithms to compute them. We first describe an
algorithm that detects rows that belong to Minimal Conflicting Sets. This
algorithm has a polynomial time complexity when the number of 1's in each row
of the considered matrix is bounded by a constant. Next, we show that the
problem of computing all Minimal Conflicting Sets can be reduced to the joint
generation of all minimal true clauses and maximal false clauses for some
monotone boolean function. We use these methods on simulated data related to
ancestral genome reconstruction to show that computing Minimal Conflicting Set
is useful in discriminating between true positive and false positive ancestral
syntenies. We also study a dataset of yeast genomes and address the reliability
of an ancestral genome proposal of the Saccahromycetaceae yeasts.

in epigenetic control that serve to regulate transcription, depending on the
particular modification states of the histone proteins. We study the stochastic
dynamics of histone protein states, taking into account a feedback mechanism
where modified nucleosomes recruit enzymes that diffuse to adjacent
nucleosomes. We map the system onto a quantum spin system whose dynamics is
generated by a non-Hermitian Hamiltonian. Making an ansatz for the solution as
a tensor product state leads to nonlinear partial differential equations that
describe the dynamics of the system. Multiple stable histone states appear in a
parameter regime whose size increases with increasing number of modification
sites. We discuss the role of the spatial dependance, and we consider the
effects of spatially heterogeneous enzymatic activity. Finally, we consider
multistability in a model of several types of correlated post-translational
modifications.

  Gene Trees under the Coalescent</title><categories>q-bio.PE</categories><comments>Additional material extends results to polytomous species trees</comments><license>http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/</license><abstract>  Gene trees are evolutionary trees representing the ancestry of genes sampled
from multiple populations. Species trees represent populations of individuals
-- each with many genes -- splitting into new populations or species. The
coalescent process, which models ancestry of gene copies within populations, is
often used to model the probability distribution of gene trees given a fixed
species tree. This multispecies coalescent model provides a framework for
phylogeneticists to infer species trees from gene trees using maximum
likelihood or Bayesian approaches. Because the coalescent models a branching
process over time, all trees are typically assumed to be rooted in this
setting. Often, however, gene trees inferred by traditional phylogenetic
methods are unrooted.
  We investigate probabilities of unrooted gene trees under the multispecies
coalescent model. We show that when there are 4 species with one gene sampled
per species, the distribution of unrooted gene tree topologies identifies the
unrooted species tree topology and some, but not all, information in the
species tree edges (branch lengths). The location of the root on the species
tree is not identifiable in this situation. However, for 5 or more species with
one gene sampled per species, we show that the distribution of unrooted gene
tree topologies identifies the rooted species tree topology and all its
internal branch lengths. The length of any pendent branch leading to a leaf of
the species tree is also identifiable for any species from which more than one
gene is sampled.

pandemic is a top public health priority. Using a compartmental model with age
structure and vaccination status, we examined the effect of age specific
scheduling of vaccination during a pandemic influenza outbreak, when there is a
race between the vaccination campaign and the dynamics of the pandemic. Our
results agree with some recent studies on that age specificity is paramount to
vaccination planning. However, little is known about the effectiveness of such
control measures when they are applied during the outbreak. Comparing five
possible strategies, we found that age specific scheduling can have a huge
impact on the outcome of the epidemic. For the best scheme, the attack rates
were up to 10% lower than for other strategies. We demonstrate the importance
of early start of the vaccination campaign, since ten days delay may increase
the attack rate by up to 6%. Taking into account the delay between developing
immunity and vaccination is a key factor in evaluating the impact of
vaccination campaigns. We provide a general framework which will be useful for
the next pandemic waves as well.

diversity. Here we construct maximum entropy models of the sequence repertoire,
building on recent experiments that provide a nearly exhaustive sampling of the
IgM sequences in zebrafish. These models are based solely on pairwise
correlations between residue positions, but correctly capture the higher order
statistical properties of the repertoire. Exploiting the interpretation of
these models as statistical physics problems, we make several predictions for
the collective properties of the sequence ensemble: the distribution of
sequences obeys Zipf's law, the repertoire decomposes into several clusters,
and there is a massive restriction of diversity due to the correlations. These
predictions are completely inconsistent with models in which amino acid
substitutions are made independently at each site, and are in good agreement
with the data. Our results suggest that antibody diversity is not limited by
the sequences encoded in the genome, and may reflect rapid adaptation to
antigenic challenges. This approach should be applicable to the study of the
global properties of other protein families.

rock-paper-scissors games with mutations. In the mean-field limit, different
behaviors are found: (a) for high mutation rate, there is a stable interior
fixed point with coexistence of all species; (b) for low mutation rates, there
is a region of the parameter space characterized by a limit cycle resulting
from a Hopf bifurcation; (c) in the absence of mutations, there is a region
where heteroclinic cycles yield oscillations of large amplitude (not robust
against noise). After a discussion on the main properties of the mean-field
dynamics, we investigate the stochastic version of the model within an
individual-based formulation. Demographic fluctuations are therefore naturally
accounted and their effects are studied using a diffusion theory complemented
by numerical simulations. It is thus shown that persistent erratic oscillations
(quasi-cycles) of large amplitude emerge from a noise-induced resonance
phenomenon. We also analytically and numerically compute the average escape
time necessary to reach a (quasi-)cycle on which the system oscillates at a
given amplitude.

generalize about relations between objects. We develop an approach to
relational learning which, given a set of pairs of objects
$\mathbf{S}=\{A^{(1)}:B^{(1)},A^{(2)}:B^{(2)},\ldots,A^{(N)}:B ^{(N)}\}$,
measures how well other pairs A:B fit in with the set $\mathbf{S}$. Our work
addresses the following question: is the relation between objects A and B
analogous to those relations found in $\mathbf{S}$? Such questions are
particularly relevant in information retrieval, where an investigator might
want to search for analogous pairs of objects that match the query set of
interest. There are many ways in which objects can be related, making the task
of measuring analogies very challenging. Our approach combines a similarity
measure on function spaces with Bayesian analysis to produce a ranking. It
requires data containing features of the objects of interest and a link matrix
specifying which relationships exist; no further attributes of such
relationships are necessary. We illustrate the potential of our method on text
analysis and information networks. An application on discovering functional
interactions between pairs of proteins is discussed in detail, where we show
that our approach can work in practice even if a small set of protein pairs is
provided.

quantitative tools and can provide a testing ground for ideas regarding the
emergence and evolution of complex biological networks. We analyze the global
statistical properties of the transcriptional regulatory network of the
prokaryote Escherichia coli, identifying each operon with a node of the
network. We propose a null model for this network using the content-based
approach applied earlier to the eukaryote Saccharomyces cerevisiae. (Balcan et
al., 2007) Random sequences that represent promoter regions and binding
sequences are associated with the nodes. The length distributions of these
sequences are extracted from the relevant databases. The network is constructed
by testing for the occurrence of binding sequences within the promoter regions.
The ensemble of emergent networks yields an exponentially decaying in-degree
distribution and a putative power law dependence for the out-degree
distribution with a flat tail, in agreement with the data. The clustering
coefficient, degree-degree correlation, rich club coefficient and k-core
visualization all agree qualitatively with the empirical network to an extent
not yet achieved by any other computational model, to our knowledge. The
significant statistical differences can point the way to further research into
non-adaptive and adaptive processes in the evolution of the E. coli GRN.

adapted by protein backbones, and yet, folded proteins show an astounding
diversity in functionality. For structure to have any bearing on function, it
is thus imperative that, apart from the protein backbone, other tunable degrees
of freedom be accountable. Here, we focus on side-chain interactions, which
non-covalently link amino acids in folded proteins to form a network structure.
At a coarse-grained level, we show that the network conforms remarkably well to
realizations of random graphs and displays associated percolation behavior.
Thus, within the rigid framework of the protein backbone that restricts the
structure space, the side-chain interactions exhibit an element of randomness,
which account for the functional flexibility and diversity shown by proteins.
However, at a finer level, the network exhibits deviations from these random
graphs which, as we demonstrate for a few specific examples, reflect the
intrinsic uniqueness in the structure and stability, and perhaps specificity in
the functioning of biological proteins.

ability to fold to their native states without any additional external forces
invoked. A mechanism is suggested for folding of these proteins, such as YibK
and YbeA, which involves an intermediate configuration with a slipknot. It
elucidates the role of topological barriers and backtracking during the folding
event. It also illustrates that native contacts are sufficient to guarantee
folding in around 1-2% of the simulations, and how slipknot intermediates are
needed to reduce the topological bottlenecks. As expected, simulations of
proteins with similar structure but with knot removed fold much more
efficiently, clearly demonstrating the origin of these topological barriers.
Although these studies are based on a simple coarse-grained model, they are
already able to extract some of the underlying principles governing folding in
such complex topologies.

readout or expression of information encoded in the genome. In many cases, a
single transcription factor protein activates or represses the expression of
many genes. As the concentration of the transcription factor varies, the target
genes thus undergo correlated changes, and this redundancy limits the ability
of the cell to transmit information about input signals. We explore how
interactions among the target genes can reduce this redundancy and optimize
information transmission. Our discussion builds on recent work [Tkacik et al,
Phys Rev E 80, 031920 (2009)], and there are connections to much earlier work
on the role of lateral inhibition in enhancing the efficiency of information
transmission in neural circuits; for simplicity we consider here the case where
the interactions have a feed forward structure, with no loops. Even with this
limitation, the networks that optimize information transmission have a
structure reminiscent of the networks found in real biological systems.

growth of their unfolding times when the stretching force crosses an
intermediate threshold. This behavior arises as a consequence of the existence
of alternative unfolding routes that are dominant at different force ranges.
Responsible for longer unfolding times at higher forces is the existence of an
intermediate, metastable configuration where the slipknot is jammed.
Simulations are performed with a coarsed grained model with further
quantification using a refined description of the geometry of the slipknots.
The simulation data is used to determine the free energy landscape (FEL) of the
protein, which supports recent analytical predictions.

through the statistical structure of their output spike trains. Here we present
a practical method, grounded in the information-theoretic analysis of
prediction, for inferring a minimal representation of that structure and for
characterizing its complexity. Starting from spike trains, our approach finds
their causal state models (CSMs), the minimal hidden Markov models or
stochastic automata capable of generating statistically identical time series.
We then use these CSMs to objectively quantify both the generalizable structure
and the idiosyncratic randomness of the spike train. Specifically, we show that
the expected algorithmic information content (the information needed to
describe the spike train exactly) can be split into three parts describing (1)
the time-invariant structure (complexity) of the minimal spike-generating
process, which describes the spike train statistically; (2) the randomness
(internal entropy rate) of the minimal spike-generating process; and (3) a
residual pure noise term not described by the minimal spike-generating process.
We use CSMs to approximate each of these quantities. The CSMs are inferred
nonparametrically from the data, making only mild regularity assumptions, via
the causal state splitting reconstruction algorithm. The methods presented here
complement more traditional spike train analyses by describing not only spiking
probability and spike train entropy, but also the complexity of a spike train's
structure. We demonstrate our approach using both simulated spike trains and
experimental data recorded in rat barrel cortex during vibrissa stimulation.

promote separation into bulk phases of two coexisting densities; this is
opposed by the logistic law for birth and death which allows only a single
uniform density to be stable. The result of this contest is an arrested
nonequilibrium phase separation in which dense droplets or rings become
separated by less dense regions, with a characteristic steady-state length
scale. Cell division mainly occurs in the dilute regions and cell death in the
dense ones, with a continuous flux between these sustained by the diffusivity
gradient. We formulate a mathematical model of this in a case involving
run-and-tumble bacteria, and make connections with a wider class of mechanisms
for density-dependent motility. No chemotaxis is assumed in the model, yet it
predicts the formation of patterns strikingly similar to those believed to
result from chemotactic behavior.

sequence belongs to a vertebrate is described and tested. This method only
needs the mtDNA sequence of the organism in question, and unlike alignment
based methods, it does not require it to be compared with anything else. The
method is tested on all 1877 mtDNA sequences that were on NCBI's nucleotide
database on August 12, 2009, and works in 94.57% of the cases. Furthermore, all
organisms on which this method failed are closely related phylogenetically in
comparison to all other organisms included in the study. A list of potential
extensions to this method and open problems that emerge out of this study is
presented at the end.

supply. In this case, disease extinction results from a large and rare
fluctuation. We show that the probability of such fluctuation can be
exponentially increased by vaccination. For periodic vaccination with fixed
average rate, the optimal vaccination protocol is model independent and
presents a sequence of short pulses. The effect of vaccination can be
resonantly enhanced if the pulse period coincides with the characteristic
period of the disease dynamics or its multiples. This resonant effect is
illustrated using a simple epidemic model. If the system is periodically
modulated, the pulses must be synchronized with the modulation, whereas in the
case of a wrong phase the vaccination can lead to a negative result. The
analysis is based on the theory of fluctuation-induced population extinction in
periodically modulated systems that we develop.

  between Fast and Slow Dispersers</title><categories>q-bio.PE</categories><comments>19 Preprint style pages and 9 figures</comments><license>http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/</license><abstract>  Dispersal is an important strategy that allows organisms to locate and
exploit favorable habitats. The question arises: given competition in a
spatially heterogeneous landscape, what is the optimal rate of dispersal?
Continuous population models predict that a species with a lower dispersal rate
always drives a competing species to extinction in the presence of spatial
variation of resources. However, the introduction of intrinsic demographic
stochasticity can reverse this conclusion. We present a simple model in which
competition between the exploitation of resources and stochastic fluctuations
leads to victory by either the faster or slower of two species depending on the
environmental parameters. A simplified limiting case of the model, analyzed by
closing the moment and correlation hierarchy, quantitatively predicts which
species will win in the complete model under given parameters of spatial
variation and average carrying capacity.

discriminant function to separate sequences of a specific pattern from
background. In computational biology, motif detection is used to predict DNA
binding sites of a transcription factor (TF), mostly based on the weight matrix
(WM) model or the Gibbs free energy (FE) model. However, despite the wide
applications, theoretical analysis of these two models and their predictions is
still lacking. We derive asymptotic error rates of prediction procedures based
on these models under different data generation assumptions. This allows a
theoretical comparison between the WM-based and the FE-based predictions in
terms of asymptotic efficiency. Applications of the theoretical results are
demonstrated with empirical studies on ChIP-seq data and protein binding
microarray data. We find that, irrespective of underlying data generation
mechanisms, the FE approach shows higher or comparable predictive power
relative to the WM approach when the number of observed binding sites used for
constructing a discriminant decision is not too small.

(PRC) describes how such neurons will respond to small excitatory
perturbations. Knowledge of the PRC is important as it is associated to the
excitability type of neurons and their capability to synchronize in networks.
In this work we present a novel method to estimate the PRC from experimental
data. We assume that continuous noise signal can be discretized into
independent perturbations at evenly spaced phases and predict the next spike
based on these independent perturbations. The difference between the predicted
next spike made at every discretized phase and the actual next spike time is
used as the error signal used to optimize the PRC. We test our method on model
data and experimentally obtained data and find that the newly developed method
is robust and reliable method for the estimation of PRCs from experimental
data.

the formation of DNA loops--a ubiquitous means of regulating the expression of

formation when a tension of 200 fN is applied to the substrate DNA, biasing the
thermal fluctuations that drive loop formation and breakdown events.
Conversely, once looped, the DNA-protein complex is insensitive to applied
force. Our measurements are in excellent agreement with a simple polymer model
of loop formation in DNA, and show that an anti-parallel topology is the
preferred LacI-DNA loop conformation for a generic loop-forming construct.

better understanding of their functioning. Hybridization thermodynamics for
nucleic acid strands in aqueous solution can be described by the so-called
nearest-neighbor model, which estimates the hybridization free energy of a
given sequence as a sum of dinucleotide terms. Compared with its solution
counterparts, hybridization in DNA microarrays may be hindered due to the
presence of a solid surface and of a high density of DNA strands. We present
here a study aimed at the determination of hybridization free energies in DNA
microarrays. Experiments are performed on custom Agilent slides. The solution
contains a single oligonucleotide. The microarray contains spots with a perfect
matching complementary sequence and other spots with one or two mismatches: in
total 1006 different probe spots, each replicated 15 times per microarray. The
free energy parameters are directly fitted from microarray data. The
experiments demonstrate a clear correlation between hybridization free energies
in the microarray and in solution. The experiments are fully consistent with
the Langmuir model at low intensities, but show a clear deviation at
intermediate (non-saturating) intensities. These results provide new
interesting insights for the quantification of molecular interactions in DNA
microarrays.

individual and networks of firing-rate neurons, adapting to achieve target
distributions of firing rates maximizing information entropy. We show that any
finite polyhomeostatic adaption rate destroys all attractors in Hopfield-like
network setups, leading to intermittently bursting behavior and self-organized
chaos. The importance of polyhomeostasis to adapting behavior in general is
discussed.

economics and sociology. The vast amounts of data are usually represented in
the form of matrices and can be considered as knowledge networks. Spectra-based
approaches have proved useful in extracting hidden information within such
networks and for estimating missing data, but these methods are based
essentially on linear assumptions. The physical models of matching, when
applicable, often suggest non-linear mechanisms, that may sometimes be
identified as noise. The use of non-linear models in data analysis, however,
may require the introduction of many parameters, which lowers the statistical
weight of the model. According to the quality of data, a simpler linear
analysis may be more convenient than more complex approaches.
  In this paper, we show how a simple non-parametric Bayesian model may be used
to explore the role of non-linearities and noise in synthetic and experimental
data sets.

the dissemination of structural data from single-particle reconstructions of
supramolecular protein assemblies including motors, chaperones, cytoskeletal
assemblies, and viral capsids. While the static structure of these assemblies
provides essential insight into their biological function, their conformational
dynamics and mechanics provide additional important information regarding the
mechanism of their biological function. Here, we present an unsupervised
computational framework to analyze and store for public access the
conformational dynamics of supramolecular protein assemblies deposited in the
EMDB. Conformational dynamics are analyzed using normal mode analysis in the
finite element framework, which is used to compute equilibrium thermal
fluctuations, cross-correlations in molecular motions, and strain energy
distributions for 452 of the 681 entries stored in the EMDB at present. Results
for the viral capsid of hepatitis B, ribosome-bound termination factor RF2, and
GroEL are presented in detail and validated with all-atom based models. The
conformational dynamics of protein assemblies in the EMDB may be useful in the
interpretation of their biological function, as well as in the classification
and refinement of EM-based structures.

bacteria upon receptor binding in an essentially spontaneous way. This downhill
thermodynamic process from the intact virion toward the empty viral capsid plus
released DNA is made possible by the energy stored during active packaging of
the genome into the capsid. Only indirect measurements of this energy have been
available until now using either single-molecule or osmotic suppression
techniques. In this paper, we describe for the first time the use of isothermal
titration calorimetry to directly measure the heat released (or equivalently
the enthalpy) during DNA ejection from phage lambda, triggered in solution by a
solubilized receptor. Quantitative analyses of the results lead to the
identification of thermodynamic determinants associated with DNA ejection. The
values obtained were found to be consistent with those previously predicted by
analytical models and numerical simulations. Moreover, the results confirm the
role of DNA hydration in the energetics of genome confinement in viral capsids.

selection with respect to sampling variations has long been under-considered.
It is only until recently that this issue has received more and more attention.
In this article, we review existing stable feature selection methods for
biomarker discovery using a generic hierarchal framework. We have two
objectives: (1) providing an overview on this new yet fast growing topic for a
convenient reference; (2) categorizing existing methods under an expandable
framework for future research and development.

  to improve the GO-based similarity measure between proteins</title><categories>cs.CE q-bio.GN</categories><license>http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/</license><abstract>  The Gene Ontology (GO) provides a knowledge base to effectively describe
proteins. However, measuring similarity between proteins based on GO remains a
challenge. In this paper, we propose a new similarity measure, information
coefficient similarity measure (SimIC), to effectively integrate both the
information content (IC) of GO terms and the structural information of GO
hierarchy to determine the similarity between proteins. Testing on yeast
proteins, our results show that SimIC efficiently addresses the shallow
annotation issue in GO, thus improves the correlations between GO similarities
of yeast proteins and their expression similarities as well as between GO
similarities of yeast proteins and their sequence similarities. Furthermore, we
demonstrate that the proposed SimIC is superior in predicting yeast protein
interactions. We predict 20484 yeast protein-protein interactions (PPIs)
between 2462 proteins based on the high SimIC values of biological process (BP)
and cellular component (CC). Examining the 214 MIPS complexes in our predicted
PPIs shows that all members of 159 MIPS complexes can be found in our PPI
predictions, which is more than those (120/214) found in PPIs predicted by
relative specificity similarity (RSS). Integrating IC and structural
information of GO hierarchy can improve the effectiveness of the semantic
similarity measure of GO terms. The new SimIC can effectively correct the
effect of shallow annotation, and then provide an effective way to measure
similarity between proteins based on Gene Ontology.

determining community structure and function is well established. However,
community ecology studies have mainly focused on simple competition and
predation systems, and the relative impact of positive interspecific
interactions in shaping communities in a spatial context is not well
understood. Here we employ a spatially explicit metacommunity model to
investigate the effect of local dispersal on the structure and function of
communities in which species are linked through an interaction web comprising
mutualism, competition and exploitation. Our results show that function,
diversity and interspecific interactions of locally linked communities undergo
a phase transition with changes in the rate of species dispersal. We find that
low spatial interconnectedness favors the spontaneous emergence of strongly
mutualistic communities which are more stable but less productive and diverse.
On the other hand, high spatial interconnectedness promotes local biodiversity
at the expense of local stability and supports communities with a wide range of
interspecific interactions. We argue that investigations of the relationship
between spatial processes and the self-organization of complex interaction webs
are critical to understanding the geographic structure of interactions in real
landscapes.

interactions between linked loci. A paradigmatic case where recombination is
known to be strongly disadvantageous is a two-locus fitness landscape dis-
playing reciprocal sign epistasis with two fitness peaks of unequal height.
Focusing on the occurrence of bistability in the equilibrium solutions, we
consider here the deterministic, haploid two-locus model with reversible mu-
tations, selection and recombination. We find analytic formulae for the criti-
cal recombination probability rc above which two stable stationary solutions
appear which are localized on each of the two fitness peaks. We also derive the
stationary genotype frequencies in various parameter regimes. When the
recombination rate is close to rc and the fitness difference between the two
peaks is small, we obtain a compact description in terms of a cubic polyno-
mial which is analogous to the Landau theory of physical phase transitions.

and evolve complex cultures reflects the following two underlying cognitive
transitions. The transition from the coarse-grained associative memory of Homo
habilis to the fine-grained memory of Homo erectus enabled limited
representational redescription of perceptually similar episodes, abstraction,
and analytic thought, the last of which is modeled as the formation of states
and of lattices of properties and contexts for concepts. The transition to the
modern mind of Homo sapiens is proposed to have resulted from onset of the
capacity to spontaneously and temporarily shift to an associative mode of
thought conducive to interaction amongst seemingly disparate concepts, modeled
as the forging of conjunctions resulting in states of entanglement. The fruits
of associative thought became ingredients for analytic thought, and vice versa.
The ratio of associative pathways to concepts surpassed a percolation threshold
resulting in the emergence of a self-modifying, integrated internal model of
the world, or worldview.

rely on human intervention; the artist selects the most aesthetically pleasing
variants of one generation to produce the next. This paper discusses how
computer generated art and design can become more creatively human-like with
respect to both process and outcome. As an example of a step in this direction,
we present an algorithm that overcomes the above limitation by employing an
automatic fitness function. The goal is to evolve abstract portraits of Darwin,
using our 2nd generation fitness function which rewards genomes that not just
produce a likeness of Darwin but exhibit certain strategies characteristic of
human artists. We note that in human creativity, change is less choosing
amongst randomly generated variants and more capitalizing on the associative
structure of a conceptual network to hone in on a vision. We discuss how to
achieve this fluidity algorithmically.

interact to control cellular processes by transcriptional activation of a set
of target genes. Many methods have been developed to use statistical
correlations in high-throughput datasets to infer such interactions. However,
cellular pathways are highly cooperative, often requiring the joint effect of
many molecules, and few methods have been proposed to explicitly identify such
higher-order interactions, partially due to the fact that the notion of
multivariate statistical dependency itself remains imprecisely defined. We
define the concept of dependence among multiple variables using maximum entropy
techniques and introduce computational tests for their identification.
Synthetic network results reveal that this procedure uncovers dependencies even
in undersampled regimes, when the joint probability distribution cannot be
reliably estimated. Analysis of microarray data from human B cells reveals that
third-order statistics, but not second-order ones, uncover relationships
between genes that interact in a pathway to cooperatively regulate a common set
of targets.

cycles using a combination of analytical and computational methods. Using
principles from structural kinetic modeling (SKM), we show that the stability
of metabolic networks with certain structural regularities can be studied using
a combination of analytical and computational techniques. We then apply these
techniques to a class of single input, single output metabolic cycles, and find
that the cycles are stable under all conditions tested. Next, we extend our
analysis to a small autocatalytic cycle, and determine parameter regimes within
which the cycle is very likely to be stable. We demonstrate that analytical
methods can be used to understand the relationship between kinetic parameters
and stability, and that results from these analytical methods can be confirmed
with computational experiments. In addition, our results suggest that elevated
metabolite concentrations and certain crucial saturation parameters can
strongly affect the stability of the entire metabolic cycle. We discuss our
results in light of the possibility that evolutionary forces may select for
metabolic network topologies with a high intrinsic probability of being stable.
Furthermore, our conclusions support the hypothesis that certain types of
metabolic cycles may have played a role in the development of primitive
metabolism despite the absence of regulatory mechanisms.

in whole genome remains a challenge for the researchers. Now a days, the genome
wide regulatory binding site prediction tools required either direct pattern
sequence or weight matrix. Although there are known transcription factor
binding sites databases available for genome wide prediction but no tool is
available which can construct different weight matrices as per need of user or
tools available for large data set scanning by first aligning the input
upstream or promoter sequences and than construct the matrices in different
level and file format. Considering this, we developed a DNA MATRIX tool for
searching putative regulatory binding sites in gene upstream sequences. This
tool uses the simple biological rule based heuristic algorithm for weight
matrix construction, which can be transformed into different formats after
motif alignment and therefore provides the possibility to identify the most
potential conserved binding sites in the regulated genes. The user may
construct and save specific weight or frequency matrices in different form and
file formats based on user based selection of conserved aligned block of short
sequences ranges from 6 to 20 base pairs and prior nucleotide frequency before
weight scoring.

research community. The researchers attempt to develop faster, more scalable
algorithms to navigate over the ever increasing volumes of spatial gene
expression data in search of meaningful patterns. Association rules are a data
mining technique that tries to identify intrinsic patterns in spatial gene
expression data. It has been widely used in different applications, a lot of
algorithms introduced to discover these rules. However Priori like algorithms
has been used to find positive association rules. In contrast to positive
rules, negative rules encapsulate relationship between the occurrences of one
set of items with absence of the other set of items. In this paper, an
algorithm for mining negative association rules from spatial gene expression
data is introduced. The algorithm intends to discover the negative association
rules which are complementary to the association rules often generated by
Priori like algorithm. Our study shows that negative association rules can be
discovered efficiently from spatial gene expression data.

field of molecular systematics. Many phylogenetic models are often at stake and
different approaches are used to compare them within a Bayesian framework. The
Bayes factor, defined as the ratio of the marginal likelihoods of two competing
models, plays a key role in Bayesian model selection. We focus on an
alternative estimator of the marginal likelihood whose computation is still a
challenging problem. Several computational solutions have been proposed none of
which can be considered outperforming the others simultaneously in terms of
simplicity of implementation, computational burden and precision of the
estimates. Practitioners and researchers, often led by available software, have
privileged so far the simplicity of the harmonic mean estimator (HM) and the
arithmetic mean estimator (AM). However it is known that the resulting
estimates of the Bayesian evidence in favor of one model are biased and often
inaccurate up to having an infinite variance so that the reliability of the
corresponding conclusions is doubtful. Our new implementation of the
generalized harmonic mean (GHM) idea recycles MCMC simulations from the
posterior, shares the computational simplicity of the original HM estimator,
but, unlike it, overcomes the infinite variance issue. The alternative
estimator is applied to simulated phylogenetic data and produces fully
satisfactory results outperforming those simple estimators currently provided
by most of the publicly available software.

the detection of a target sequence from a complex mixture of nucleic acids.

systems (continuous deterministic dynamic coupled with jump Markov processes)
in the fluid limit (small jumps at high frequency), thus extending known
results for jump Markov processes. We prove a functional law of large numbers
with exponential convergence speed, derive a diffusion approximation and
establish a functional central limit theorem. We apply these results to neuron
models with stochastic ion channels, as the number of channels goes to
infinity, estimating the convergence to the deterministic model. In terms of
neural coding, we apply our central limit theorems to estimate numerically
impact of channel noise both on frequency and spike timing coding.

  Problem</title><categories>q-bio.QM</categories><comments>13 pages, 2 figures</comments><license>http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/</license><abstract>  Multivariate methods that relate outcomes to risk factors have been adopted
clinically to individualize treatment. This has promoted the belief that
individuals have a true or unique risk.
  The logic of assigning an individual a single risk value has been criticized
since 1866. The reason is that any individual can be simultaneously considered
a member of different groups, with each group having its own risk level (the
reference class problem).
  Lemeshow et al. provided well-documented examples of remarkable discordance
between predictions for an individual by different valid predictive methods
utilizing different risk factors. The prevalence of such discordance is unknown
as it is rarely evaluated, but must be substantial due to the abundance of risk
factors.
  Lemeshow et al. cautioned against using ICU mortality predictions for the
provision of care to individual patients. If individual risk estimates are used
clinically, users should be aware that valid methods may give very different
results.

m) circular polarization image in the Orion nebula, where massive stars and
many low-mass stars are forming. Our results reveal that a high circular
polarization region is spatially extended (~0.4 pc) around the massive
star-forming region, the BN/KL nebula. However, other regions, including the
linearly polarized Orion bar, show no significant circular polarization. Most
of the low-mass young stars do not show detectable extended structure in either
linear or circular polarization, in contrast to the BN/KL nebula. If our solar
system formed in a massive star-forming region and was irradiated by net
circularly polarized radiation, then enantiomeric excesses could have been
induced, through asymmetric photochemistry, in the parent bodies of the
meteorites and subsequently delivered to Earth. These could then have played a
role in the development of biological homochirality on Earth.

coupled with an evolutionary technique, becomes an evo-devo (or "artificial
embryology", or "computational development") method to generate 2d or 3d sets
of artificial cells arbitrarily shaped. 'In silico' experiments have proved the
effectiveness of the method in devo-evolving any kind of shape, of any
complexity (in terms of number of cells, number of colours, etc.); being shape
complexity a metaphor for organismal complexity, such simulations established
its potential to generate the complexity typical of biological systems.
Moreover, it has also been shown how the underlying model of cellular
development is able to produce the artificial version of key biological
phenomena such as embryogenesis, the presence of "junk DNA", the phenomenon of
ageing and the process of carcinogenesis. The objective of this document is not
to provide new material (most of the material presented here has already been
published elsewhere): rather, it is to provide all details that, for lack of
space, could not be provided in the published papers and in particular to give
all technical details necessary to re-implement the method.

trees from aligned sequence data. In this short note, we formally show that the
maximum posterior tree topology provides a statistically consistent estimate of
a fully-resolved evolutionary tree under a wide variety of conditions. This
includes the inference of gene trees from aligned sequence data across the
entire parameter range of branch lengths, and under general conditions on
priors in models where the usual `identifiability' conditions hold. We extend
this to the inference of species trees from sequence data, where the gene trees
constitute `nuisance parameters', as in the program *BEAST. This note also
addresses earlier concerns raised in the literature questioning the extent to
which statistical consistency for Bayesian methods might hold in general.

  an Application to Protein Structural Alignment</title><categories>q-bio.QM q-bio.BM</categories><comments>8 pages, 5 figures</comments><license>http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/</license><abstract>  Motivation: Protein sequence world is discrete as 20 amino acids (AA) while
its structure world is continuous, though can be discretized into structural
alphabets (SA). In order to reveal the relationship between sequence and
structure, it is interesting to consider both AA and SA in a joint space.
However, such space has too many parameters, so the reduction of AA is
necessary to bring down the parameter numbers.
  Result: We've developed a simple but effective approach called entropic
clustering based on selecting the best mutual information between a given
reduction of AAs and SAs. The optimized reduction of AA into two groups leads
to hydrophobic and hydrophilic. Combined with our SA, namely conformational
letter (CL) of 17 alphabets, we get a joint alphabet called hydropathy
conformational letter (hp-CL). A joint substitution matrix with (17*2)*(17*2)
indices is derived from FSSP. Moreover, we check the three coding systems, say
AA, CL and hp-CL against a large database consisting proteins from family to
fold, with their performance on the TopK accuracy of both similar fragment pair
(SFP) and the neighbor of aligned fragment pair (AFP). The TopK selection is
according to the score calculated by the coding system's substitution matrix.
Finally, embedding hp-CL in a pairwise alignment algorithm, say CLeFAPS, to
replace the original CL, will get an improvement on the HOMSTRAD benchmark.

genotypic and phenotypic diversity. We analyze a model of viral competition
between two different viral strains infecting a constantly replenished cell
pool, in which we assume a trade-off between the virus' colonization skills
(cell killing ability or virulence) and its local competition skills
(replication performance within coinfected cells). We characterize the
conditions that allow for viral spread by means of the basic reproductive
number and show that a local coexistence equilibrium exists, which is
asymptotically stable. At this equilibrium, the less virulent competitor has a
reproductive advantage over the more virulent colonizer. The equilibria at
which one strain outcompetes the other one are unstable, i.e., a second viral
strain is always able to permanently invade. One generalization of the model is
to consider multiple viral strains, each one displaying a different virulence.
However, to account for the large phenotypic diversity in viral populations, we
consider a continuous spectrum of virulences and present a continuum limit of
this multiple viral strains model that describes the time evolution of an
initial continuous distribution of virulence. We provide a proof of the
existence of solutions of the model's equations and present numerical
approximations of solutions for different initial distributions. Our
simulations suggest that initial continuous distributions of virulence evolve
towards a stationary distribution that is extremely skewed in favor of
competitors. Consequently, collective virulence attenuation takes place. This
finding may contribute to understanding the phenomenon of virulence
attenuation, which has been reported in previous experimental studies.

large-scale gene expression data often lack robustness and stability, rendering
their biological interpretation challenging. Increasing the signature's
interpretability and stability across perturbations of a given dataset and, if
possible, across datasets, is urgently needed to ease the discovery of
important biological processes and, eventually, new drug targets. Results : We
propose a new method to construct signatures with increased stability and
easier interpretability. The method uses a gene network as side interpretation
and enforces a large connectivity among the genes in the signature, leading to
signatures typically made of genes clustered in a few subnetworks. It combines
the recently proposed graph Lasso procedure with a stability selection
procedure. We evaluate its relevance for the estimation of a prognostic
signature in breast cancer, and highlight in particular the increase in
interpretability and stability of the signature.

feedforward structure, as is traditionally used to model inter-neuron
connectivity, with a layer of undifferentiated connections which model the
diffuse projections from the human limbic system to the cortex. This new layer
makes it possible to model global effects such as salience, at the same time as
the local network processes task-specific or local information. This simple
combination network displays interactions between salience and regular
processing which correspond to known effects in the developing brain, such as
enhanced learning as a result of heightened affect.
  The cortex biases neuronal responses to affect both learning and memory,
through the use of diffuse projections from the limbic system to the cortex.
Standard ANNs do not model this non-local flow of information represented by
the ascending systems, which are a significant feature of the structure of the
brain, and although they do allow associational learning with multiple-trial,
they simply don't provide the capacity for one-time learning.
  In this research we model this effect using an artificial neural network
(ANN), creating a salience-affected neural network (SANN). We adapt an ANN to
embody the capacity to respond to an input salience signal and to produce a
reverse salience signal during testing.
  This research demonstrates that input combinations similar to the inputs in
the training data sets will produce similar reverse salience signals during
testing. Furthermore, this research has uncovered a novel method for training
ANNs with a single training iteration.

particles given by hydrodynamic equations for the density and polarization
fields. We find that the ordered moving or flocking state of the system is
unstable to spatial fluctuations beyond a threshold set by the self-propulsion
velocity of the individual units. In this region, the system organizes itself
into an inhomogeneous state of well-defined propagating stripes of flocking
particles interspersed with low density disordered regions. Further, we find
that even in the regime where the homogeneous flocking state is stable, the
system exhibits large fluctuations in both density and orientational order. We
study the hydrodynamic equations analytically and numerically to characterize
both regimes.

requirements for high-probability phylogeny reconstruction and the related
problem of the estimation of ancestral sequences. In [Daskalakis et al.'09],
building on the work of [Mossel'04], a tight sequence-length requirement was
obtained for the CFN model. In particular the required sequence length for
high-probability reconstruction was shown to undergo a sharp transition (from
$O(\log n)$ to $\hbox{poly}(n)$, where $n$ is the number of leaves) at the
"critical" branch length $\critmlq$ (if it exists) of the ancestral
reconstruction problem.
  Here we consider the GTR model. For this model, recent results of [Roch'09]
show that the tree can be accurately reconstructed with sequences of length
$O(\log(n))$ when the branch lengths are below $\critksq$, known as the
Kesten-Stigum (KS) bound. Although for the CFN model $\critmlq = \critksq$, it
is known that for the more general GTR models one has $\critmlq \geq \critksq$
with a strict inequality in many cases. Here, we show that this phenomenon also
holds for phylogenetic reconstruction by exhibiting a family of symmetric
models $Q$ and a phylogenetic reconstruction algorithm which recovers the tree
from $O(\log n)$-length sequences for some branch lengths in the range
$(\critksq,\critmlq)$. Second we prove that phylogenetic reconstruction under
GTR models requires a polynomial sequence-length for branch lengths above
$\critmlq$.

knowledge discovery in spatial gene expression databases. The set of admissible
rules for the selected support and confidence thresholds can easily be
extracted by algorithms based on support and confidence, such as Apriori.
However, they may produce a large number of rules, many of them are
uninteresting. The challenge in association rule mining (ARM) essentially
becomes one of determining which rules are the most interesting. Association
rule interestingness measures are used to help select and rank association rule
patterns. Besides support and confidence, there are other interestingness
measures, which include generality reliability, peculiarity, novelty,
surprisingness, utility, and applicability. In this paper, the application of
the interesting measures entropy and variance for association pattern discovery
from spatial gene expression data has been studied. In this study the fast
mining algorithm has been used which produce candidate itemsets and it spends
less time for calculating k-supports of the itemsets with the Boolean matrix
pruned, and it scans the database only once and needs less memory space.
Experimental results show that using entropy as the measure of interest for the
spatial gene expression data has more diverse and interesting rules.

function. From a microscopic point of view, protein dynamics is governed by the
local atomic interactions that, in turn, trigger the functional conformational
changes. Unfortunately, the relationship between local atomic fluctuations and
global protein rearrangements is still elusive. Here, atomistic molecular
dynamics simulations in conjunction with complex network analysis show that
fast peptide relaxations effectively build the backbone of the global
free-energy landscape, providing a connection between local and global atomic
rearrangements. A minimum-spanning-tree representation, built on the base of
transition gradients networks, results in a high resolution mapping of the
system dynamics and thermodynamics without requiring any a priori knowledge of
the relevant degrees of freedom. These results suggest the presence of a local
mechanism for the high communication efficiency generally observed in complex
systems.

  calibration points for estimating divergence dates</title><categories>q-bio.PE</categories><comments>8 pages, including 1 Table</comments><license>http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/</license><abstract>  There has been concern in the literature about the methodology of using
secondary calibration timepoints when estimating evolutionary divergence dates.
Such timepoints are divergence time estimates that have been derived from one
molecular data set on the basis of a primary external calibration timepoint,
and which are then used independently on a second data set. Logically, the
primary and secondary calibration points must be mutually consistent, in the
sense that it must be possible to predict each time point from the other.
However, the attempt by Shaul and Graur (2002, Gene 300: 59-61) to assess the
reliability of secondary timepoints is flawed because they presented time
estimates without presenting confidence intervals on those estimates, and so it
was not possible to make any explicit hypothesis tests of divergence times.
Also, they inappropriately excluded some of the data, which leads to a very
biased estimate of one of the divergence times. Here, I present a re-analysis
of the same data set, with more appropriate methodology, and come to the
conclusion that no inconsistencies are involved. However, it is clear from the
analysis that molecular data often have such large confidence intervals that
they are uninformative, and thus cannot be used for reliable hypothesis tests.

of suspensions of self-propelled dipolar cells in a tubular flow. General
expressions for the mean drift and effective diffusivity are determined exactly
in terms of axial moments, and compared with an approximation a la Taylor. As
in the Taylor-Aris case, the skewness of a finite distribution of biased
swimming cells vanishes at long times. The general expressions can be applied
to particular models of swimming microorganisms, and thus be used to predict
swimming drift and diffusion in tubular bioreactors, and to elucidate competing
unbounded swimming drift and diffusion descriptions. Here, specific examples
are presented for gyrotactic swimming algae.

series of simulations in order to assess the extent to which the bayesian
posterior probabilities associated with phylogenetic trees represent the
standard frequentist statistical interpretation. They concluded that when the
analysis model matches the generating model then the bayesian posterior
probabilities are correct, but that the probabilities are much too large when
the model is under-specified and slightly too small when the model is
over-specified. Here, I take issue with the first conclusion, and instead
contend that their simulation data show that the posterior probabilities are
still slightly too large even when the models match. Furthermore, I suggest
that the data show that the degree of this over-estimation increases as the
sequence length increases, and that it might increase as model complexity
increases. I also provide some comments on the authors' conclusions concerning
whether bootstrap proportions over- or under-estimate the true probabilities.

evolution, but also cultural evolution in humans. In this context, successful
strategies spread by imitation. It has been shown that the details of strategy
update rules can have a crucial impact on evolutionary dynamics in theoretical
models and e.g. significantly alter the level of cooperation in social
dilemmas. But what kind of strategy update rules can describe imitation
dynamics in humans? Here, we present a way to measure such strategy update
rules in a behavioral experiment. We use a setting in which individuals are
virtually arranged on a spatial lattice. This produces a large number of
different strategic situations from which we can assess strategy updating. Most
importantly, spontaneous strategy changes corresponding to mutations or
exploration behavior are more frequent than assumed in many models. Our
experimental approach to measure properties of the update mechanisms used in
theoretical models will be useful for mathematical models of cultural
evolution.

practical issue, given the rapidly increasing number of mitogenomes appearing
in the public databases. Unfortunately, tRNA genes in Metazoan mitochondria
have proved to be problematic because they often vary in number (genes missing
or duplicated) and also in the secondary structure of the transcribed tRNAs (T
or D arms missing). I have performed a series of comparative analyses of the
tRNA genes of a broad range of Metazoan mitogenomes in order to address this
issue. I conclude that no single computer program is necessarily capable of
finding all of the tRNA genes in any given mitogenome, and that use of both the
ARWEN and DOGMA programs is sometimes necessary because they produce
complementary false negatives. There are apparently a very large number of
erroneous annotations in the databased mitogenome sequences, including missed
genes, wrongly annotated locations, false complements, and inconsistent
criteria for assigning the 5' and 3' boundaries; and I have listed many of
these. The extent of overlap between genes is often greatly exaggerated due to
inconsistent annotations, although notable overlaps involving tRNAs are
apparently real. Finally, three novel hypotheses were examined and found to
have support from the comparative analyses: (1) some organisms have mitogenomic
locations that simultaneously code for multiple tRNAs; (2) some organisms have
mitogenomic locations that simultaneously code for tRNAs and proteins (but not
rRNAs); and (3) one group of nematodes has several genes that code for tRNAs
lacking both the D and T arms.

observed in marine ecosystems. Three dynamical systems are considered,
describing the abundance of organisms as a function of body mass and time: a
"jump-growth" equation, a first order approximation which is the widely used
McKendrick-von Foerster equation, and a second order approximation which is the
McKendrick-von Foerster equation with a diffusion term. All of these yield a
power-law steady state. We derive, for the first time, the eigenvalue spectrum
for the linearised evolution operator, under certain constraints on the
parameters. This provides new knowledge of the stability properties of the
power-law steady state. It is shown analytically that the steady state of the
McKendrick-von Foerster equation without the diffusion term is always unstable.
Furthermore, numerical plots show that eigenvalue spectra of the McKendrick-von
Foerster equation with diffusion give a good approximation to those of the
jump-growth equation. The steady state is more likely to be stable with a low
preferred predator : prey mass ratio, a large diet breadth and a high feeding
efficiency.

takes into account the stochastic nature of input current and the uncertainty
in synaptic coupling. This approach was proved to be a rigorous limit of the
network equations in a general setting, and we express here the results in a
more customary and simpler framework. We propose a heuristic argument to derive
these equations providing a more intuitive understanding of their origin. These
equations are characterized by a strong coupling between the different moments
of the solutions. We analyse the equations, present an algorithm to simulate
the solutions of these mean-field equations, and investigate numerically the
equations. In particular, we build a bridge between these equations and
Sompolinsky and collaborators approach (1988, 1990), and show how the coupling
between the mean and the covariance function deviates from customary
approaches.

analyzed for the case of scale free steady state networks. It is found that
contrary to what one would have naively expected, the rewiring process
typically tends to suppress epidemic spreading. In particular it is found that
as in static networks, rewiring networks with degree distribution exponent
$\gamma &gt;3$ exhibit a threshold in the infection rate below which epidemics die
out in the steady state. However the threshold is higher in the rewiring case.
For $2&lt;\gamma \leq 3$ no such threshold exists, but for small infection rate
the steady state density of infected nodes (prevalence) is smaller for rewiring
networks.

process where the population rate of change depends on the distribution of
properties--so different cohorts change at different rates. We investigate the
effect on the evolution arising from parametrized perturbations of uniformity
for the initial inhomogeneity. The information geometric neighbourhood system
yields also solutions for a wide range of other initial inhomogeneity
distributions, including approximations to truncated Gaussians of arbitrarily
small variance and distributions with pronounced extreme values. It is found
that, under quite considerable alterations in the shape and variance of the
initial distribution of inhomogeneity in unfitness, the decline of the mean
does change markedly with the variation in starting conditions, but the net
population evolution seems surprisingly stable.

The
models have stochastic population dynamics with mutation, migration, and
extinction of species. Mutants appear as a result of mutation of the resident
species, while migrants have no correlation with the resident species. It is
found that the dynamics of community assembly with mutations are quite
different from the case with migrations. In contrast to mutation models, which
show intermittent dynamics of quasi-steady states interrupted by sudden
reorganizations of the community, migration models show smooth and gradual
renewal of the community. As a consequence, instead of the $1/f$ diversity
fluctuations found for the mutation models, $1/f^2$, random-walk like
fluctuations are observed for the migration models. In addition, a
characteristic species-lifetime distribution is found: a power law that is cut
off by a "skewed" distribution in the long-lifetime regime. The latter has a
longer tail than a simple exponential function, which indicates an
age-dependent species-mortality function. Since this characteristic profile has
been observed, both in fossil data and in several other mathematical models, we
conclude that it is a universal feature of macroevolution.

  Without RNAnet comparison across experiments in GEO is very labour intensive
requiring man months of effort to down load and clean data. With RNAnet anyone
can access cleaned quantile normalised data in seconds. It can be used to data

huge but sparse. Thousands of genes interact strongly with thousands of others.
Conversely there are tens of thousands of genes which interact strongly with

interactions that create a periodic pattern in the Drosophila eye imaginal
disc. This model is capable of generating a regular hexagonal pattern of gene
expression behind a moving front, as observed in the fly system. In order to
better understand the novel switch and template mechanism behind this pattern
formation, we present here a detailed study of the model's behavior in one
dimension, using a combination of analytic methods and numerical searches of
parameter space. We find that patterns are created robustly provided that there
is an appropriate separation of timescales and that self-activation is
sufficiently strong, and we derive expressions in this limit for the front
speed and the pattern wavelength. Moving fronts in pattern-forming systems near
an initial linear instability generically select a unique pattern, but our
model operates in a strongly nonlinear regime where the final pattern depends
on the initial conditions as well as on parameter values. Our work highlights
the important role that cellularization and cell-autonomous feedback can play
in biological pattern formation.

of biological coevolution models of community assembly. The noise is induced in
order to check the validity of deterministic population dynamics. While
mutualistic communities show little dependence on the stochastic population
fluctuations, predator-prey models show strong dependence on the stochasticity,
indicating the relevance of the finiteness of the populations. For a
predator-prey model, the noise causes drastic decreases in diversity and total
population size. The communities that emerge under influence of the noise
consist of species strongly coupled with each other and have stronger linear
stability around the fixed-point populations than the corresponding noiseless
model. The dynamics on evolutionary time scales for the predator-prey model are
also altered by the noise. Approximate $1/f$ fluctuations are observed with
noise, while $1/f^{2}$ fluctuations are found for the model without demographic
noise.

in the resulting protein sequence, which prevents classic protein alignment
methods from revealing the proteins' common origin. Moreover, when a large
number of substitutions are additionally involved in the divergence, the
homology detection becomes difficult even at the DNA level. To cope with this
situation, we propose a novel method to infer distant homology relations of two
proteins, that accounts for frameshift and point mutations that may have
affected the coding sequences. We design a dynamic programming alignment
algorithm over memory-efficient graph representations of the complete set of
putative DNA sequences of each protein, with the goal of determining the two
putative DNA sequences which have the best scoring alignment under a powerful
scoring system designed to reflect the most probable evolutionary process. This
allows us to uncover evolutionary information that is not captured by
traditional alignment methods, which is confirmed by biologically significant
examples.

to explain the biological complexity of living systems is shifting from
analyzing the individual components (such as a particular gene or biochemical
reaction) to understanding the set of interactions amongst the large number of
components that results in the different functions of the organism. To this
end, the area of systems biology attempts to achieve a "systems-level"
description of biology by focusing on the network of interactions instead of
the characteristics of its isolated parts. In this article, we briefly describe
some of the emerging themes of research in "network" biology, looking at
dynamical processes occurring at the two different length scales of within the
cell and between cells, viz., the intra-cellular signaling network and the
nervous system. We show that focusing on the systems-level aspects of these
problems allows one to observe surprising and illuminating common themes
amongst them.

  Proteaceae species</title><categories>q-bio.PE</categories><comments>15 pages, including 4 Figures and 4 Tables</comments><license>http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/</license><abstract>  The seed bank dynamics of the three co-occurring obligate-seeder (i.e.
fire-sensitive) Proteaceae species, Banksia ericifolia, Banksia marginata and
Petrophile pulchella, were examined at sites of varying time since the most
recent fire (i.e. plant age) in the Sydney region. Significant variation among
species was found in the number of cones produced, the position of the cones
within the canopy, the percentage of barren cones produced (Banksia species
only), the number of follicles/bracts produced per cone, and the number of
seeds lost/released due to spontaneous fruit rupture. Thus, three different
regeneration strategies were observed, highlighting the variation in
reproductive strategies of co-occurring Proteaceae species. Ultimately, B.
marginata potentially accumulated a seed bank of c. 3000 seeds per plant after
20 years, with c. 1500 seeds per plant for P. pulchella and c. 500 for B.
ericifolia. Based on these data, B. marginata and B. ericifolia require a
minimum fire-free period of 8-10 years, with 7-8 years for P. pulchella, to
allow for an adequate seed bank to accumulate and thus ensure local persistence
of these species in fire-prone habitats.

components. These complex dynamics can be modeled using Boolean networks,
allowing us to explain the existence of different cell states and the
transition between them. Boolean models have been introduced both as specific
examples and as ensemble or distribution network models. However, current
ensemble Boolean network models do not make a systematic distinction between
different cell components such as epigenetic factors, gene and transcription
factors. Consequently, we still do not understand their relative contributions
in controlling the cell fate. In this work we introduce and study higher order
Boolean networks, which feature an explicit distinction between the different
cell components and the types of interactions between them. We show that the
stability of the cell state dynamics can be determined solving the eigenvalue
problem of a matrix representing the regulatory interactions and their
strengths. The qualitative analysis of this problem indicates that, in addition
to the classification into stable and chaotic regimes, the cell state can be
simple or complex depending on whether it can be deduced from the independent
study of its components or not. Finally, we illustrate how the model can be
expanded considering higher levels and higher order dynamics.

  genome-wide case-control studies</title><categories>q-bio.GN cs.CE q-bio.QM</categories><comments>Submitted</comments><license>http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/</license><abstract>  Gene-gene interactions have long been recognized to be fundamentally
important to understand genetic causes of complex disease traits. At present,
identifying gene-gene interactions from genome-wide case-control studies is
computationally and methodologically challenging. In this paper, we introduce a
simple but powerful method, named `BOolean Operation based Screening and
Testing'(BOOST). To discover unknown gene-gene interactions that underlie
complex diseases, BOOST allows examining all pairwise interactions in
genome-wide case-control studies in a remarkably fast manner. We have carried
out interaction analyses on seven data sets from the Wellcome Trust Case
Control Consortium (WTCCC). Each analysis took less than 60 hours on a standard
3.0 GHz desktop with 4G memory running Windows XP system. The interaction
patterns identified from the type 1 diabetes data set display significant
difference from those identified from the rheumatoid arthritis data set, while
both data sets share a very similar hit region in the WTCCC report. BOOST has
also identified many undiscovered interactions between genes in the major
histocompatibility complex (MHC) region in the type 1 diabetes data set. In the
coming era of large-scale interaction mapping in genome-wide case-control
studies, our method can serve as a computationally and statistically useful
tool.

between the nonlinear dynamics of evolutionary selection forces and random
fluctuations arising from the stochastic nature of the interactions. The
processes leading to extinction of species, whose understanding is a key
component in the study of evolution and biodiversity, are influenced by both of
these factors.
  In this paper, we investigate a class of stochastic population dynamics
models based on generalized Lotka-Volterra systems. In the case of neutral
stability of the underlying deterministic model, the impact of intrinsic noise
on the survival of species is dramatic: it destroys coexistence of interacting
species on a time scale proportional to the population size. We introduce a new
method based on stochastic averaging which allows one to understand this
extinction process quantitatively by reduction to a lower-dimensional effective
dynamics. This is performed analytically for two highly symmetrical models and
can be generalized numerically to more complex situations. The extinction
probability distributions and other quantities of interest we obtain show
excellent agreement with simulations.

species) to a data set can alter the structure of the optimal phylogenetic tree
in surprising ways. However, little is known about this "rogue taxon" effect.
In this paper we characterize the behavior of balanced minimum evolution (BME)
phylogenetics on data sets of this type using tools from polyhedral geometry.
First we show that for any distance matrix there exist distances to a "rogue
taxon" such that the BME-optimal tree for the data set with the new taxon does
not contain any nontrivial splits (bipartitions) of the optimal tree for the
original data. Second, we prove a theorem which restricts the topology of
BME-optimal trees for data sets of this type, thus showing that a rogue taxon
cannot have an arbitrary effect on the optimal tree. Third, we construct
polyhedral cones computationally which give complete answers for BME rogue
taxon behavior when our original data fits a tree on four, five, and six taxa.
We use these cones to derive sufficient conditions for rogue taxon behavior for
four taxa, and to understand the frequency of the rogue taxon effect via
simulation.

identifying genetic modules whose behavior can be modeled accurately so as to
gain insight into their structure and function. However most gene circuits in a
cell are under control of external signals and thus quantitative agreement
between experimental data and a mathematical model is difficult. Circadian
biology has been one notable exception: quantitative models of the internal
clock that orchestrates biological processes over the 24-hour diurnal cycle
have been constructed for a few organisms, from cyanobacteria to plants and
mammals. In most cases, a complex architecture with interlocked feedback loops
has been evidenced. Here we present first modeling results for the circadian
clock of the green unicellular alga Ostreococcus tauri. Two plant-like clock
genes have been shown to play a central role in Ostreococcus clock. We find
that their expression time profiles can be accurately reproduced by a minimal
model of a two-gene transcriptional feedback loop. Remarkably, best adjustment
of data recorded under light/dark alternation is obtained when assuming that
the oscillator is not coupled to the diurnal cycle. This suggests that coupling
to light is confined to specific time intervals and has no dynamical effect
when the oscillator is entrained by the diurnal cycle. This intringuing
property may reflect a strategy to minimize the impact of fluctuations in
daylight intensity on the core circadian oscillator, a type of perturbation
that has been rarely considered when assessing the robustness of circadian
clocks.

during meiosis is highly correlated with their physical length while it differs
significantly when their coding density is considered. Furthermore, it has been
observed that the recombination events are distributed unevenly along the
chromosomes. We have found that many of such recombination properties can be
predicted by computer simulations of population evolution based on the Monte
Carlo methods. For example, these simulations have shown that the probability
of acceptance of the recombination events by selection is higher at the ends of
chromosomes and lower in their middle parts. The regions of high coding density
are more prone to enter the strategy of haplotype complementation and to form
clusters of genes which are "recombination deserts". The phenomenon of
switching in-between the purifying selection and haplotype complementation has
a phase transition character, and many relations between the effective
population size, coding density, chromosome size and recombination frequency
are those of the power law type.

works. The famous Hodgkin-Huxley model, which describes how action potentials
of a neuron are initiated and propagated, consists of four coupled nonlinear
differential equations. Because these equations are difficult to deal with,
there also exist several simplified models, of which many exhibit
polynomial-like non-linearity. Examples of such models are the Fitzhugh-Nagumo
(FHN) model, the Hindmarsh-Rose (HR) model, the Morris-Lecar (ML) model and the
Izhikevich model. In this work, we first prescribe the biologically relevant
parameter ranges for the FHN model and subsequently study the dynamical
behaviour of coupled neurons on small networks of two or three nodes. To do
this, we use a computational real algebraic geometry method called the
Discriminant Variety (DV) method to perform the stability and bifurcation
analysis of these small networks. A time series analysis of the FHN model can
be found elsewhere in related work[15].

Studies on submerged fermentation revealed that maximum level of enzyme
production was during early stationary phase. Optimum pH, inoculum and
temperature were 9.0, 3 percent and 33 C respectively. Among carbon sources 0.3
peccent starch gave a maximum production followed by maltose, xylose and
fructose. High yield of protease production was reported with 1.0 percent
casein followed by soybean meal, yeast extract and malt extract. Further, it
was optimized with 0.5 percent, 1.0 percentand 1.5 percent of NaCl among which
1 percent NaCl resulted in maximum level of protease. The protease profile of
the isolate shows its potential as a good source for industrial application.

a challenge to understanding the basis of genetic diseases. This is
particularly true for proteins related to diseases for which there are no

functional mutations. The Homo sapiens Shwachman Bodian Diamond Syndrome gene
hSBDS is responsible for SDS. hSBDS is expressed in all tissues and encodes a
protein of 250 amino acids SwissProt accession code Q9Y3A5. Sequence analysis
of disease associated alleles has identified more than 20 different mutations
in affected individuals. While a number of these mutations have been described
as leading to the loss of protein function due to truncation, translation or
surface epitope association, the structural basis for these mutations has yet
to be determined due to the lack of a three-dimensional structure for SBDS.

professional busy with image processing tasks and problems. In the computer
vision community there is a widespread belief that artificial vision systems
faithfully replicate human vision abilities or at least very closely mimic
them. It was a great surprise to me when one day I have realized that computer
and human vision have next to nothing in common. The former is occupied with
extensive data processing, carrying out massive pixel-based calculations, while
the latter is busy with meaningful information processing, concerned with smart
objects-based manipulations. And the gap between the two is insurmountable. To
resolve this confusion, I had had to return and revaluate first the vision
phenomenon itself, define more carefully what visual information is and how to
treat it properly. In this work I have not been, as it is usually accepted,
biologically inspired . On the contrary, I have drawn my inspirations from a
pure mathematical theory, the Kolmogorov s complexity theory. The results of my
work have been already published elsewhere. So the objective of this paper is
to try and apply the insights gained in course of this my enterprise to a more
general case of information processing in human brain and the challenging issue
of human intelligence.

interactions in complex systems of many variables. A shortcoming of the
standard framework for Granger causality is that it only allows for examination
of interactions between single (univariate) variables within a system, perhaps
conditioned on other variables. However, interactions do not necessarily take
place between single variables, but may occur among groups, or "ensembles", of
variables. In this study we establish a principled framework for Granger
causality in the context of causal interactions among two or more multivariate
sets of variables. Building on Geweke's seminal 1982 work, we offer new
justifications for one particular form of multivariate Granger causality based
on the generalized variances of residual errors. Taken together, our results
support a comprehensive and theoretically consistent extension of Granger
causality to the multivariate case. Treated individually, they highlight
several specific advantages of the generalized variance measure, which we
illustrate using applications in neuroscience as an example. We further show
how the measure can be used to define "partial" Granger causality in the
multivariate context and we also motivate reformulations of "causal density"
and "Granger autonomy". Our results are directly applicable to experimental
data and promise to reveal new types of functional relations in complex
systems, neural and otherwise.

graphs derived from the niche model and compare synthetic food webs with real
data. Doing so, we find new tests for the goodness of synthetic food web models
and indicate a possible direction of improvement for existing ones. We then
exploit the weighted overlap graphs to define a competition kernel for
Lotka-Volterra population dynamics and find that for such a model the stability
of food webs decreases with its ecological complexity.

evolving protein families is a major factor that stymies evolutionary studies.
In this manuscript, we propose a Multiple Sequence Alignment (MSA) independent
method to infer evolutionary relationships. We previously demonstrated that
phylogenetic profiles built using position specific scoring matrices (PSSMs)
are capable of constructing informative evolutionary histories(1;2). In this
manuscript, we theorize that PSSMs derived specifically from the query
sequences used to construct the phylogenetic tree will improve this method for
the study of rapidly evolving proteins. To test this theory, we performed
phylogenetic analyses of a benchmark protein superfamily (reverse
transcriptases (RT)) as well as simulated datasets. When we compare the results
obtained from our method, PHYlogenetic ReconstructioN (PHYRN), with other MSA
dependent methods, we observe that PHYRN provides a 4- to 100-fold increase in
accurate measurements at deep nodes. As phylogenetic profiles are used as the
information source, rather than MSA, we propose PHYRN as a paradigm shift in
studying evolution when MSA approaches fail. Perhaps most importantly, due to
the improvements in our computational approach and the availability of vast
amount of sequencing data, PHYRN is scalable to thousands of sequences. Taken
together with PHYRNs adaptability to any protein family, this method can serve
as a tool for resolving ambiguities in evolutionary studies of rapidly
evolving/highly divergent protein families.

connected by tight junctions is analyzed using a spectral method. The
polarizability of this system is obtained as an expansion over the eigenmodes
of the linear response operator, showing a clear separation of geometry from
electric parameters. The eigenmode with the second largest eigenvalue dominates
the expansion as the junction between particles tightens, but only when the
applied field is aligned with the cluster axis. This effect explains a distinct
low-frequency relaxation observed in the impedance spectrum of a suspension of
linear clusters.

network models of proteins for predicting many equilibrium properties related
to collective modes of motion. Curiously, the results are usually robust
towards the different cutoff distances used for constructing the residue
networks from the knowledge of the experimental coordinates. In this study, we
present a systematical study of network construction, and their effect on the
predicted properties. Probing bond orientational order around each residue, we
propose a natural partitioning of the interactions into an essential and a
residual set. In this picture the robustness originates from the way with which
new contacts are added so that an unusual local orientational order builds up.
These residual interactions have a vanishingly small effect on the force
vectors on each residue. The stability of the overall force balance then
translates into the Hessian as small shifts in the slow modes of motion and an
invariance of the corresponding eigenvectors. We introduce a rescaled version
of the Hessian matrix and point out a link between the matrix Frobenius norm
based on spectral stability arguments. A recipe for the optimal choice of
partitioning the interactions into essential and residual components is
prescribed. Implications for the study of biologically relevant properties of
proteins are discussed with specific examples.

Hemisphere is still uncertain. Plans for vaccination campaigns and vaccine
trials are underway, with the first batches expected to be available early
October. Several studies point to the possibility of an anticipated pandemic
peak that could undermine the effectiveness of vaccination strategies. Here we
use a structured global epidemic and mobility metapopulation model to assess
the effectiveness of massive vaccination campaigns for the Fall/Winter 2009.
Mitigation effects are explored depending on the interplay between the
predicted pandemic evolution and the expected delivery of vaccines. The model
is calibrated using recent estimates on the transmissibility of the new A(H1N1)
influenza. Results show that if additional intervention strategies were not
used to delay the time of pandemic peak, vaccination may not be able to
considerably reduce the cumulative number of cases, even when the mass
vaccination campaign is started as early as mid-October. Prioritized
vaccination would be crucial in slowing down the pandemic evolution and
reducing its burden.

allowing some form of switching when, depending on their initial conditions,
solutions of the dynamical system end up in different regions of state space
(associated with different biochemical functions). Switching is often realized
by a bistable system (i.e. a dynamical system allowing two stable steady state
solutions) and, in the majority of cases, bistability is established
numerically. In our point of view this approach is too restrictive, as, one the
one hand, due to predominant parameter uncertainty numerical methods are
generally difficult to apply to realistic models originating in Systems
Biology. And on the other hand switching already arises with the occurrence of
a saddle type steady state (characterized by a Jacobian where exactly one
Eigenvalue is positive and the remaining eigenvalues have negative real part).
Consequently we derive conditions based on linear inequalities that allow the
analytic computation of states and parameters where the Jacobian derived from a
mass action network has a defective zero eigenvalue so that -- under certain
genericity conditions -- a saddle-node bifurcation occurs. Our conditions are
applicable to general mass action networks involving at least one conservation
relation, however, they are only sufficient (as infeasibility of linear
inequalities does not exclude defective zero eigenvalues).

  reconstruction</title><categories>q-bio.PE</categories><comments>13 pages, 8 figures</comments><license>http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/</license><abstract>  In many interesting cases the reconstruction of a correct phylogeny is
blurred by high mutation rates and/or horizontal transfer events. As a
consequence a divergence arises between the true evolutionary distances and the
differences between pairs of taxa as inferred from available data, making the
phylogenetic reconstruction a challenging problem. Mathematically this
divergence translates in a loss of additivity of the actual distances between
taxa. In distance-based reconstruction methods, two properties of additive
distances were extensively exploited as antagonist criteria to drive phylogeny
reconstruction: on the one hand a local property of quartets, i.e., sets of
four taxa in a tree, the four-points condition; on the other hand a recently
proposed formula that allows to write the tree length as a function of the
distances between taxa, the Pauplin's formula. Here we introduce a new
reconstruction scheme, that exploits in a unified framework both the
four-points condition and the Pauplin's formula. We propose, in particular, a
new general class of distance-based Stochastic Local Search algorithms, which
reduces in a limit case to the minimization of the Pauplin's length. When
tested on artificially generated phylogenies our Stochastic Big-Quartet
Swapping algorithmic scheme significantly outperforms state-of-art
distance-based algorithms in cases of deviation from additivity due to high
rate of back mutations. A significant improvement is also observed with respect
to the state-of-art algorithms in case of high rate of horizontal transfer.

essential for understanding the stochastic nature of tissue cell deformation
under applied load. In the existing literature, the population variation of
single-cell creep compliance has so far been modeled universally by using a
log-normal distribution. Here we use optical stretching, a non-contact and
relatively high-throughput technique for probing cell mechanics, to accumulate
a sufficient data set that demonstrates robustly that cell compliance varies
according to the similar but distinct gamma distribution. Additionally, we
re-examine existing simulations that were originally proposed to justify a
log-normal fit, and show that in fact these simulation data also correspond to
the gamma distribution. Finally, we propose a general stochastic differential
equation that analytically predicts a gamma distribution of creep compliance
during cell stretching, as well as the Gaussian distribution of cell recovery
that we observe experimentally upon removal of applied load. The population
variation is well characterized by just a single parameter in each of the creep
and recovery regimes. We expect our correction of a phenomenological
distribution fit, enabled by an expansive data set for mesenchymal stem cells,
to enable the development of more accurate constitutive laws to describe
cytoskeletal deformation. These findings thus serve to replace an empirical
distribution with a better-fitting model that rests on a more solid
experimental and theoretical foundation, and also provides a basis to predict
and understand the stochastic nature of the mechanical response of individual
cells within populations.

force generation at kinetochores for chromosome motions have prompted
speculation regarding possible models for interactions between positively
charged molecules in kinetochores and negative charge on C-termini near the
plus ends of microtubules. A clear picture of how kinetochores establish and
maintain a dynamic coupling to microtubules for force generation during the
complex motions of mitosis remains elusive. The current paradigm of molecular
cell biology requires that specific molecules, or molecular geometries, for
force generation be identified. However, it is possible to account for mitotic
motions within a classical electrostatics approach in terms of experimentally
known cellular electric charge interacting over nanometer distances. These
charges are modeled as bound surface and volume continuum charge distributions.
Electrostatic consequences of intracellular pH changes during mitosis may
provide a master clock for the events of mitosis.

environments which form a Markov chain. The top Lyapunov exponent $a$, which
describes the long-term growth rate, depends smoothly on the demographic
parameters (represented as matrix entries) and on the parameters that define
the stochastic matrix of the driving Markov chain. The derivatives of $a$ --
the "stochastic elasticities" -- with respect to changes in the demographic
parameters were derived by \cite{tuljapurkar1990pdv}. These results are here
extended to a formula for the derivatives with respect to changes in the Markov
chain driving the environments. We supplement these formulas with rigorous
bounds on computational estimation errors, and with rigorous derivations of
both the new and the old formulas.

scales: the tumor scale, the cell-extracellular matrix (ECM) scale and the
sub-cellular scale. In this paper we consider the tumor scale in the interest
of eventually developing a system-level understanding of the progression of
cancer. At this scale, cell populations and chemical species are best treated
as concentration fields that vary with time and space. The cells have
chemo-mechanical interactions with each other and with the ECM, consume glucose
and oxygen that are transported through the tumor, and create chemical
byproducts. We present a continuum mathematical model for the biochemical
dynamics and mechanics that govern tumor growth. The biochemical dynamics and
mechanics also engender free energy changes that serve as universal measures
for comparison of these processes. Within our mathematical framework we
therefore consider the free energy inequality, which arises from the first and
second laws of thermodynamics. With the model we compute preliminary estimates
of the free energy rates of a growing tumor in its pre-vascular stage by using
currently available data from single cells and multicellular tumor spheroids.

(PDF), W D^(-{\gamma}), for small D, where 0\leq{\gamma}&lt;1. The initial
spheres' density {\rho} is non-uniform and scales with the distance (from the
origin) l as, {\rho} l^(-a), 0\leqa\leq1. An approximation for the N-particle
PDF for this problem is derived. From this solution, scaling law analysis and
numerical simulations, we show here that the mean square displacement for a
particle in such a system obeys, &lt;r^2&gt;~t^(1-{\gamma})/(2c-{\gamma}), where
c=1/(1+a). The PDF of the tagged particle is Gaussian in position.
Generalizations of these results are considered.

eukaryotic cells. One of the regulation mechanisms observed in living cells is
the severing by the proteins katanin and spastin. We introduce a model for the
dynamics of microtubules in the presence of randomly occurring severing events.
Under the biologically motivated assumption that the newly created plus end
undergoes a catastrophe, we investigate the steady state length distribution.
We show that the presence of severing does not affect the number of
microtubules, regardless of the distribution of severing events. In the special
case in which the microtubules cannot recover from the depolymerizing state (no
rescue events) we derive an analytical expression for the length distribution.
In the general case we transform the problem into a single ODE that is solved
numerically.

compartments responsible for different physiological functions. At the early
stage of epithelial layer formation, each cell of an aggregate defines an inner
and an outer side by breaking the symmetry of its initial state, in a process
known as epithelial polarization. By integrating recent biochemical and
biophysical data with stochastic simulations of the relevant reaction-diffusion
system we provide evidence that epithelial cell polarization is a chemical
phase separation process induced by a local bistability in the signaling
network at the level of the cell membrane. The early symmetry breaking event
triggering phase separation is induced by adhesion-dependent mechanical forces
localized in the point of convergence of cell surfaces when a threshold number
of confluent cells is reached. The generality of the emerging phase separation
scenario is likely common to many processes of cell polarity formation.

physiological responses known as the shade avoidance syndrome. These responses
are controlled by the synthesis of the hormone auxin, which is regulated by two
signals, an environmental one and an internal one. Considering that the auxin
signal induces plant growth after a time lag, this work shows that plant growth
can be modelled in terms of an energy-like function extremization, provided
that the Markov property is not applied. The simulated height distributions are
bimodal and right skewed, as in real community of plants. In the case of
isolated plants, the theoretical expressions for the growth dynamics and the
growth speed excellently fit experimental data for Arabidopsis thaliana.
Moreover, the growth dynamics of this model is shown to be consistent with the
biomass production function of an independent model. These results suggest that
memory effects play a non-negligible role in plant growth processes.

Biol. 266(1), 99-106 (2010)</journal-ref><license>http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/</license><abstract>  The bacterium Escherichia coli (E. coli) moves in its natural environment in
a series of straight runs, interrupted by tumbles which cause change of
direction. It performs chemotaxis towards chemo-attractants by extending the
duration of runs in the direction of the source. When there is a spatial
gradient in the attractant concentration, this bias produces a drift velocity
directed towards its source, whereas in a uniform concentration, E.coli adapts,
almost perfectly in case of methyl aspartate. Recently, microfluidic
experiments have measured the drift velocity of E.coli in precisely controlled
attractant gradients, but no general theoretical expression for the same
exists. With this motivation, we study an analytically soluble model here,
based on the Barkai-Leibler model, originally introduced to explain the perfect
adaptation. Rigorous mathematical expressions are obtained for the chemotactic
response function and the drift velocity in the limit of weak gradients and
under the assumption of completely random tumbles. The theoretical predictions
compare favorably with experimental results, especially at high concentrations.
We further show that the signal transduction network weakens the dependence of
the drift on concentration, thus enhancing the range of sensitivity.

the advent of genome-wide transcriptomics. That progress combined with the
recent discovery of regulatory non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) has necessitated fast
and accurate algorithms to predict RNA-RNA interaction probability and
structure. Although there are algorithms to predict minimum free energy
interaction secondary structure for two nucleic acids, little work has been
done to exploit the information invested in the base pair probabilities to
improve interaction structure prediction. In this paper, we present an
algorithm to predict the Hamming centroid of the Boltzmann ensemble of
interaction structures. We also present an efficient algorithm to sample
interaction structures from the ensemble. Our sampling algorithm uses a
balanced scheme for traversing indices which improves the running time of the
Ding-Lawrence sampling algorithm. The Ding-Lawrence sampling algorithm has
$O(n^2m^2)$ time complexity whereas our algorithm has $O((n+m)^2\log(n+m))$
time complexity, in which $n$ and $m$ are the lengths of input strands. We
implemented our algorithm in a new version of {\tt piRNA} and compared our
structure prediction results with competitors. Our centroid prediction
outperforms competitor minimum-free-energy prediction algorithms on average.

conformational degrees of freedom of thermally fluctuating biopolymers are
utilized in contemporary nano-devices to specifically elongate and manipulate
single chains. A thorough theoretical understanding and quantification of the
statistical conformations of confined polymer chains is thus a central concern
in polymer physics. We present an analytical calculation of the radial
distribution function of harmonically confined semiflexible polymers in the
weakly bending limit. Special emphasis has been put on a proper treatment of
global modes, i.e. the possibility of the chain to perform global movements
within the channel. We show that the effect of these global modes significantly
impacts the chain statistics in cases of weak and intermediate confinement.
Comparing our analytical model to numerical data from Monte Carlo simulations
we find excellent agreement over a broad range of parameters.

PNAS 106, 18231 (2009)] provide a
detailed spatial picture of overstretched DNA, showing that under certain
conditions the two strands of the double helix separate at about 65 pN. It was
proposed that this observation rules out the existence of an elongated,
hybridized form of DNA ('S-DNA'). Here we argue that the S-DNA picture is
consistent with the observation of unpeeling during overstretching. We
demonstrate that assuming the existence of S-DNA does not imply DNA
overstretching to consist of the complete or near-complete conversion of the
molecule from B- to S-form. Instead, this assumption implies in general a more
complex dynamic coexistence of hybridized and unhybridized forms of DNA. We
argue that such coexistence can rationalize several recent experimental
observations.

to environmental signals in real time. There is increasing evidence that
organisms may indeed be employing near optimal Bayesian calculations in their
decision-making. An intriguing question relates to the properties of optimal
encoding methods, namely determining the properties of neural populations in
sensory layers that optimize performance, subject to physiological constraints.
Within an ecological theory of neural encoding/decoding, we show that optimal
Bayesian performance requires neural adaptation which reflects environmental
changes. Specifically, we predict that neuronal tuning functions possess an
optimal width, which increases with prior uncertainty and environmental noise,
and decreases with the decoding time window. Furthermore, even for static
stimuli, we demonstrate that dynamic sensory tuning functions, acting at
relatively short time scales, lead to improved performance. Interestingly, the
narrowing of tuning functions as a function of time was recently observed in
several biological systems. Such results set the stage for a functional theory
which may explain the high reliability of sensory systems, and the utility of
neuronal adaptation occurring at multiple time scales.

sequence consists of an arrangement of the four nucleotides A, C, T and G and
different representation schemes are presented according to a probability
measure associated with them. There are different ways that probability can be
associated with the DNA sequence: one way is when the probability of an
occurrence of a letter does not depend on the previous one (termed as
unsuccessive probability) and in another scheme the probability of occurrence
of a letter depends on its previous letter (termed as successive probability).
Further, based on these probability measures graphical representations of the
schemes are also presented. Using the diagram probability measure one can
easily calculate an associated probability measure which can serve as a
parameter to check how close is a new sequence to already existing ones.

larger groups. For many groups however, there is no list of members from which
to take a random sample. Respondent-driven sampling (RDS) is a relatively new
sampling methodology that circumvents this difficulty by using the social
networks of the groups under study. The RDS method has been shown to provide
unbiased estimates of population proportions given certain conditions. The
method is now widely used in the study of HIV-related high-risk populations
globally. In this paper, we test the RDS methodology by simulating RDS studies
on the social networks of a large LGBT web community. The robustness of the RDS
method is tested by violating, one by one, the conditions under which the
method provides unbiased estimates. Results reveal that the risk of bias is
large if networks are directed, or respondents choose to invite persons based
on characteristics that are correlated with the study outcomes. If these two
problems are absent, the RDS method shows strong resistance to low response
rates and certain errors in the participants' reporting of their network sizes.
Other issues that might affect the RDS estimates, such as the method for
choosing initial participants, the maximum number of recruitments per
participant, sampling with or without replacement and variations in network
structures, are also simulated and discussed.

networks is thwarted by a physical limitation: the finite copy number of the
constituent chemical species introduces unavoidable intrinsic noise. Here we
provide a method for solving for the complete probabilistic description of
intrinsically noisy oscillatory driving. We derive and numerically verify a
number of simple scaling laws. Unlike in the case of measuring a static
quantity, response to an oscillatory driving can exhibit a resonant frequency
which maximizes information transmission. Further, we show that the optimal
regulatory design is dependent on the biophysical constraints (i.e., the
allowed copy number and response time). The resulting phase diagram illustrates
under what conditions threshold regulation outperforms linear regulation.

time. These signals are detected and processed by biochemical networks, which
are often highly stochastic. To understand how cells cope with a fluctuating
environment, we therefore have to understand how reliably biochemical networks
can transmit time-varying signals. To this end, we must understand both the
noise characteristics and the amplification properties of networks. In this
manuscript, we use information theory to study how reliably signalling cascades
employing autoregulation and feedback can transmit time-varying signals. We
calculate the frequency-dependence of the gain-to-noise ratio, which reflects
how reliably a network transmits signals at different frequencies. We find that
the gain-to-noise ratio may differ qualitatively from the power spectrum of the
output, showing that the latter does not directly reflect signaling
performance. Moreover, we find that auto-activation and auto-repression
increase and decrease the gain-to-noise ratio for all of frequencies,
respectively. Positive feedback specifically enhances information transmission
at low frequencies, while negative feedback increases signal fidelity at high
frequencies. Our analysis not only elucidates the role of autoregulation and
feedback in naturally-occurring biological networks, but also reveals design
principles that can be used for the reliable transmission of time-varying
signals in synthetic gene circuits.

the low number of plasmids successfully transferred. Here, we experimentally
determine Lipofectamine- and PEI-mediated exogenous gene expression
distributions from single cell time-lapse analysis. Broad Poisson-like
distributions of steady state expression are observed for both transfection
agents, when used with synchronized cell lines. At the same time,
co-transfection analysis with YFP- and CFP-coding plasmids shows that multiple
plasmids are simultaneously expressed, suggesting that plasmids are delivered
in correlated units (complexes). We present a mathematical model of
transfection, where a stochastic, two-step process is assumed, with the first
being the low-probability entry step of complexes into the nucleus, followed by
the subsequent release and activation of a small number of plasmids from a
delivered complex. This conceptually simple model consistently predicts the
observed fraction of transfected cells, the cotransfection ratio and the
expression level distribution. It yields the number of efficient plasmids per
complex and elucidates the origin of the associated noise, consequently
providing a platform for evaluating and improving non-viral vectors.

publication, 150 years ago, of "On the origin of species" by Charles R. Darwin.
The XXth Century witnessed great efforts to embrace replication, mutation, and
selection within the framework of a formal theory, able eventually to predict
the dynamics and fate of evolving populations. However, a large body of
empirical evidence collected over the last decades strongly suggests that some
of the assumptions of those classical models necessitate a deep revision. The
viability of organisms is not dependent on a unique and optimal genotype. The
discovery of huge sets of genotypes (or neutral networks) yielding the same
phenotype --in the last term the same organism--, reveals that, most likely,
very different functional solutions can be found, accessed and fixed in a
population through a low-cost exploration of the space of genomes. The
'evolution behind the curtain' may be the answer to some of the current puzzles
that evolutionary theory faces, like the fast speciation process that is
observed in the fossil record after very long stasis periods.

collections of neurons, we present superconducting circuits containing
Josephson junctions that model biologically realistic neurons. These "Josephson
junction neurons" reproduce many characteristic behaviors of biological neurons
such as action potentials, refractory periods, and firing thresholds. They can
be coupled together in ways that mimic electrical and chemical synapses. Using
existing fabrication technologies, large interconnected networks of Josephson
junction neurons would operate fully in parallel. They would be orders of
magnitude faster than both traditional computer simulations and biological
neural networks. Josephson junction neurons provide a new tool for exploring
long-term large-scale dynamics for networks of neurons.

life-long utility function, like the number of offsprings. A direct
computational maximization of life-long utility is however not possible in
complex environments, especially in the context, of real-world time
constraints. The central role of emotions is to serve as an intermediate layer
in the space of policies available to agents and animals, leading to a large
dimensional reduction of complexity.
  We review our current understanding of the functional role of emotions,
stressing the role of the neuromodulators mediating emotions for the diffusive
homeostatic control system of the brain. We discuss a recent proposal, that
emotional diffusive control is characterized, in contrast to neutral diffusive
control, by interaction effects, viz by interferences between emotional arousal
and reward signaling. Several proposals for the realization of synthetic
emotions are discussed in this context, together with key open issues regarding
the interplay between emotional motivational drives and diffusive control.

size and resource availability. Here, we have developed a model to integrate
these two drivers, accounting explicitly for the scaling of perceived resource
availability with individual body size. The model merges a Kleiber-like scaling
law with Holling functional responses into a single mathematical framework,
involving both body-size the density of resources.
  When the availability of resources is held constant the model predicts a
relationship between resource intake rates and body sizes whose log-log graph
is a concave curve. The significant deviation from a power law accounts for the
body size dependency of resource limitations. The model results are consistent
with data from both a laboratory experiment on benthic macro-invertebrates and
the available literature.

Venter Institute reported construction
of very long DNA molecules using a variety of experimental procedures adopting
a number of working hypotheses. Finding a mathematical rule for generation of
such a long sequence would revolutionize our thinking on various advanced areas
of biology, viz. evolution of long DNA chains in chromosomes, reasons for
existence of long stretches of non-coding regions as well as would usher
automated methods for long DNA chains preparation for chromosome engineering.
However, this mathematical principle must have room for editing / correcting
DNA sequences locally in those areas of genomes where mutation and / or DNA
polymerase has introduced errors over millions of years. In this paper, we
report the basics and applications of L-system (a mathematical principle) which
could answer all the aforesaid issues. At the end, we present the whole human
mitochondrial genome which has been generated using this mathematical principle
using PC computation power. We can claim now that we can make any stretch of
DNA, be it 936 bp of olfactory receptor, with or without introns, mitochondrial
DNA to 3 x 109 bp DNA sequences of the whole human genome with even a PC
computation power.

efficiently storing and accessing experimental data. In this work, we focus on
the management of LC-MS data, which are typically made available in standard
XML-based portable formats. The structures that are currently employed to
manage these data can be highly inefficient, especially when dealing with
high-throughput profile data. LC-MS datasets are usually accessed through 2D
range queries. Optimizing this type of operation could dramatically reduce the
complexity of data analysis. We propose a novel data structure for LC-MS
datasets, called mzRTree, which embodies a scalable index based on the R-tree
data structure. mzRTree can be efficiently created from the XML-based data
formats and it is suitable for handling very large datasets. We experimentally
show that, on all range queries, mzRTree outperforms other known structures
used for LC-MS data, even on those queries these structures are optimized for.
Besides, mzRTree is also more space efficient. As a result, mzRTree reduces
data analysis computational costs for very large profile datasets.

Eigen models of quasispecies theory, for fitness functions that depend in an
arbitrary way on the number of mutations from the wild type. We include back
mutations in our description. We show that the fluctuation of the population
numbers about the average values are exceedingly large in these physical models
of evolution. We further show that horizontal gene transfer reduces by orders
of magnitude the fluctuations in the population numbers and reduces the
accumulation of deleterious mutations in the finite population due to Muller's
ratchet. Indeed the population sizes needed to converge to the infinite
population limit are often larger than those found in nature for smooth fitness
functions in the absence of horizontal gene transfer. These analytical results
are derived for the steady-state by means of a field-theoretic representation.
Numerical results are presented that indicate horizontal gene transfer speeds
up the dynamics of evolution as well.

sensing of concentration ramps, which is often the biologically relevant
situation (e.g. during bacterial chemotaxis). We calculate lower bounds on the
uncertainty of ramp sensing by three measurement devices: a single receptor, an
absorbing sphere, and a monitoring sphere. We contrast two strategies, simple
linear regression of the input signal versus maximum likelihood estimation, and
show that the latter can be twice as accurate as the former. Finally, we
consider biological implementations of these two strategies, and identify
possible signatures that maximum likelihood estimation is implemented by real
biological systems.

  https://sites.google.com/site/journalofcomputing/</journal-ref><license>http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/</license><abstract>  G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) constitute a broad class of cell-surface
receptors in eukaryotes and they possess seven transmembrane a-helical domains.
GPCRs are usually classified into several functionally distinct families that
play a key role in cellular signalling and regulation of basic physiological
processes. We can develop statistical models based on these common features
that can be used to classify proteins, to predict new members, and to study the
sequence-function relationship of this protein function group. In this study,
SVM based classification model has been developed for the identification of
human gpcr sequences. Sequences of Level 1 subfamilies of Class A rhodopsin is
considered as case study. In the present study, an attempt has been made to
classify GPCRs on the basis of species. The present study classifies human gpcr
sequences with rest of the species available in GPCRDB. Classification is based
on specific information derived from the n-terminal and extracellular loops of
the sequences, some physicochemical properties and amino acid composition of
corresponding gpcr sequences. Our method classifies Level 1 subfamilies of
GPCRs with 94% accuracy.

biological systems. We perceive flux as the flow of resources in stochastic
simulations. We resort to an established correspondence between event
structures, a broadly recognised model of concurrency, and state transitions of
process models, seen as Petri nets. We show that we can this way extract the
causal resource dependencies in simulations between individual state
transitions as partial orders of events. We propose transformations on the
partial orders that provide means for further analysis, and introduce a
software tool, which implements these ideas. By means of an example of a
published model of the Rho GTP-binding proteins, we argue that this approach
can provide the substitute for flux analysis techniques on ordinary
differential equation models within the stochastic setting of process algebras.

coordination of cellular activity. Cross-talk between pathways accounts for
many of the complex behaviours exhibited by signalling pathways and is often
critical in producing the correct signal-response relationship. Formal models
of signalling pathways and cross-talk in particular can aid understanding and
drive experimentation. We define an approach to modelling based on the concept
that a pathway is the (synchronising) parallel composition of instances of
generic modules (with internal and external labels). Pathways are then composed
by (synchronising) parallel composition and renaming; different types of
cross-talk result from different combinations of synchronisation and renaming.
We define a number of generic modules in PRISM and five types of cross-talk:
signal flow, substrate availability, receptor function, gene expression and
intracellular communication. We show that Continuous Stochastic Logic
properties can both detect and distinguish the types of cross-talk. The
approach is illustrated with small examples and an analysis of the cross-talk
between the TGF-b/BMP, WNT and MAPK pathways.

one of their advantages as a modelling technique. It is certainly true that in
biochemical systems, as in many other systems, model construction is made
easier in a formalism which allows the problem to be tackled compositionally.
In this paper we consider the extent to which the compositional structure which
is inherent in process algebra models of biochemical systems can be exploited
during model solution. In essence this means using the compositional structure
to guide decomposed solution and analysis.
  Unfortunately the dynamic behaviour of biochemical systems exhibits strong
interdependencies between the components of the model making decomposed
solution a difficult task. Nevertheless we believe that if such decomposition
based on process algebras could be established it would demonstrate substantial
benefits for systems biology modelling. In this paper we present our
preliminary investigations based on a case study of the pheromone pathway in
yeast, modelling in the stochastic process algebra Bio-PEPA.

molecular association processes (e.g. Molecule recognition in Signaling or
catalysis). Instead Brownian Dynamics (BD) simulations are commonly used to
estimate the rate of diffusional association, e.g. to be later used in
mesoscopic simulations. Meanwhile a portfolio of diffusional association (DA)
methods have been developed that exploit BD.
  However, DA methods do not clearly distinguish between modeling, simulation,
and experiment settings. This hampers to classify and compare the existing
methods with respect to, for instance model assumptions, simulation
approximations or specific optimization strategies for steering the computation
of trajectories.
  To address this deficiency we propose FADA (Flexible Architecture for
Diffusional Association) - an architecture that allows the flexible definition
of the experiment comprising a formal description of the model in SpacePi,
different simulators, as well as validation and analysis methods. Based on the
NAM (Northrup-Allison-McCammon) method, which forms the basis of many existing
DA methods, we illustrate the structure and functioning of FADA. A discussion
of future validation experiments illuminates how the FADA can be exploited in
order to estimate reaction rates and how validation techniques may be applied
to validate additional features of the model.

behavior of biological systems. Theoretical modeling provides a useful
framework for understanding the dynamics and the function of such networks. The
complexity of the biological networks calls for conceptual tools that manage
the combinatorial explosion of the set of possible interactions. A suitable
conceptual tool to attack complexity is compositionality, already successfully
used in the process algebra field to model computer systems. We rely on the
BlenX programming language, originated by the beta-binders process calculus, to
specify and simulate high-level descriptions of biological circuits. The
Gillespie's stochastic framework of BlenX requires the decomposition of
phenomenological functions into basic elementary reactions. Systematic
unpacking of complex reaction mechanisms into BlenX templates is shown in this
study. The estimation/derivation of missing parameters and the challenges
emerging from compositional model building in stochastic process algebras are
discussed. A biological example on circadian clock is presented as a case study
of BlenX compositionality.

compartmentalization, molecular localization and movements between
compartments. In this paper we enrich this calculus with a static type system
classifying each ambient with group types specifying the kind of compartments
in which the ambient can stay. The type system ensures that, in a well-typed
process, ambients cannot be nested in a way that violates the type hierarchy.
Exploiting the information given by the group types, we also extend the
operational semantics of BioAmbients with rules signalling errors that may
derive from undesired ambients' moves (i.e. merging incompatible tissues).
Thus, the signal of errors can help the modeller to detect and locate unwanted
situations that may arise in a biological system, and give practical hints on
how to avoid the undesired behaviour.

networks. This set of properties aims at making precise several notions on the
production of metabolites, which are familiar in the biologists' terminology.
  From a theoretical point of view, biochemical reactions are abstractly
represented as causal implications and the produced metabolites as causal
consequences of the implication representing the corresponding reaction. The
fact that a reactant is produced is represented by means of the chain of
reactions that have made it exist. Such representation abstracts away from
quantities, stoichiometric and thermodynamic parameters and constitutes the
basis for the characterization of our properties. Moreover, we propose an
effective method for verifying our properties based on an abstract model of
system dynamics. This consists of a new abstract semantics for the system seen
as a concurrent network and expressed using the Chemical Ground Form calculus.
  We illustrate an application of this framework to a portion of a real
metabolic pathway.

  selection</title><categories>q-bio.PE</categories><comments>11 pages, 5 figures</comments><license>http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/</license><abstract>  The origin of altruistic behavior, i.e. the behavior that is useful for a
population or a species but goes at the expense of an altruistic individual,
has long been a challenge for students of evolutionary biology. The populations
with altruistic individuals thrive better than those without altruists;
however, the altruists within a population thrive worse than the non-altruists
and their prevalence in the population decreases due to individual selection.
Under certain conditions, the strength of group selection, i.e. the competition
between populations, can surpass the strength of individual selection; however,
such conditions are rarely achieved in practice. It was suggested recently that
chances for altruistic behavior to spread highly increase when it is controlled
not by a single gene but by multiple independent genes substitutable in their
effects on the phenotype of the individual. Here we confirm the original verbal
model published as part of the frozen plasticity theory by numerical modeling
of the spread of altruistic/selfish alleles in a metapopulation consisting of
partly isolated groups of organisms (demes) interconnected by migration. We
have shown that altruistic behavior coded by multiple substitutable genes can
stably coexist with selfish behavior, even under relatively high mutation and
migration rates, i.e. under such conditions where altruistic behavior coded by
a single gene is quickly outcompeted in a metapopulation.

The part
of the visual scene corresponding to the eye center is represented densely,
while away from the center the sampling becomes progressively sparser. Such
distribution allows a more effective use of the limited transfer rate of the
optic nerve, since animals can aim area centralis (AC) at the relevant position
in the scene by performing saccadic eye movements. To locate a new saccade
target the animal has to sample the corresponding region of the visual scene,
away from AC. In this work we derive the sampling density away from AC, which
optimizes the trajectory of saccadic eye movements. We obtain the scaling law
for the sampling density as a function of eccentricity, which results from the
evolutionary pressure to locate the target in the shortest time under the
constraint of limited transfer rate of the optic nerve. In case of very small
AC the visual scene is optimally represented by logarithmic conformal mapping,
in which geometrically similar circular bands around AC are equally represented
by the visual system. We also obtain corrections to the logarithmic scaling for
the case of a larger AC and compare them to experimental findings.

behavior of disease spreading on both static and adaptive networked systems.
This unifying approach relies on the annealed adjacency matrix, representing
one network ensemble, and allows to solve the dynamical evolution of the whole
network ensemble all at once. Our results accurately reproduce those obtained
by extensive numerical simulations showing a large improvement with respect to
the usual heterogeneous mean-field formulation. Moreover, by means of the
annealed formulation we derive a new heterogeneous mean-field formulation that
correctly reproduces the epidemic dynamics.

the genome, promoting uncontrolled growth or disabling defenses against it.
Identifying genomic regions whose DNA copy number deviates from the normal is
therefore central to understanding cancer evolution. Array-based comparative
genomic hybridization (aCGH) is a high-throughput technique for identifying DNA
gain or loss by quantifying total amounts of DNA matching defined probes
relative to healthy diploid control samples. Due to the high level of noise in
microarray data, however, interpretation of aCGH output is a difficult and
error-prone task.
  In this work, we tackle the computational task of inferring the DNA copy
number per genomic position from noisy aCGH data. We propose CGHTRIMMER, a
novel segmentation method that uses a fast dynamic programming algorithm to
solve for a least-squares objective function for copy number assignment.
CGHTRIMMER consistently achieves superior precision and recall to leading
competitors on benchmarks of synthetic data and real data from the Coriell cell
lines. In addition, it finds several novel markers not recorded in the
benchmarks but plausibly supported in the oncology literature. Furthermore,
CGHTRIMMER achieves superior results with run-times from 1 to 3 orders of
magnitude faster than its state-of-art competitors.
  CGHTRIMMER provides a new alternative for the problem of aCGH discretization
that provides superior detection of fine-scale regions of gain or loss yet is
fast enough to process very large data sets in seconds. It thus meets an
important need for methods capable of handling the vast amounts of data being
accumulated in high-throughput studies of tumor genetics.

extinction consists in the developing a dormant stage in which the organism is
unable to multiply but may die. The dormant organism is protected against the
poisonous environment. The result is to increase the survival probability of
the entire population by introducing a type of zero reproductive fitness. This
is possible, because the reservoir of dormant individuals act as a buffer that
can cushion fatal fluctuations in the number of births and deaths which without
the dormant population would have driven the entire population to extinction.

important issue. In this work we consider populations where the behavior of
every single cell can be described by a system of ordinary differential
equations. Heterogeneity among individual cells is accounted for by differences
in parameter values and initial conditions. Hereby, parameter values and
initial conditions are subject to a distribution function which is part of the
model specification. Based on the single cell model and the considered
parameter distribution, a partial differential equation model describing the
distribution of cells in the state and in the output space is derived.
  For the estimation of the parameter distribution within the model, we
consider experimental data as obtained from flow cytometric analysis. From
these noise-corrupted data a density-based statistical data model is derived.
Using this data model the parameter distribution within the cell population is
computed using convex optimization techniques.
  To evaluate the proposed method, a model for the caspase activation cascade
is considered. It is shown that for known noise properties the unknown
parameter distributions in this model are well estimated by the proposed
method.

to the 24-hour day/night cycle. The clock of the green alga Ostreococcus tauri
is the simplest plant clock discovered so far. Its many advantages as an
experimental system facilitate the testing of computational predictions.
  We present a model of the Ostreococcus clock in the stochastic process
algebra Bio-PEPA and exploit its mapping to different analysis techniques, such
as ordinary differential equations, stochastic simulation algorithms and
model-checking. The small number of molecules reported for this system tests
the limits of the continuous approximation underlying differential equations.
We investigate the difference between continuous-deterministic and
discrete-stochastic approaches. Stochastic simulation and model-checking allow
us to formulate new hypotheses on the system behaviour, such as the presence of
self-sustained oscillations in single cells under constant light conditions.
  We investigate how to model the timing of dawn and dusk in the context of
model-checking, which we use to compute how the probability distributions of
key biochemical species change over time. These show that the relative
variation in expression level is smallest at the time of peak expression,
making peak time an optimal experimental phase marker. Building on these
analyses, we use approaches from evolutionary systems biology to investigate
how changes in the rate of mRNA degradation impacts the phase of a key protein
likely to affect fitness. We explore how robust this circadian clock is towards
such potential mutational changes in its underlying biochemistry. Our work
shows that multiple approaches lead to a more complete understanding of the
clock.

between widely distributed neural assemblies to understand conscious
perception. These neural assemblies form intricate networks of neurons and
synapses whose detailed map for mammals is still unknown and far from our
experimental capabilities. Only in a few cases, for example the C. elegans, we
know the complete mapping of the neuronal tissue or its mesoscopic level of
description provided by cortical areas. Here we study the process of transient
and global synchronization using a simple model of phase-coupled oscillators
assigned to cortical areas in the cerebral cat cortex. Our results highlight
the impact of the topological connectivity in the developing of
synchronization, revealing a transition in the synchronization organization
that goes from a modular decentralized coherence to a centralized synchronized
regime controlled by a few cortical areas forming a Rich-Club connectivity
pattern.

  cells</title><categories>q-bio.NC</categories><license>http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/</license><abstract>  Mitral cells of the olfactory bulb form sparse representations of the
odorants and transmit this information to the cortex. The olfactory code
carried by the mitral cells is sparser than the inputs that they receive. In
this study we analyze the mechanisms and functional significance of sparse
olfactory codes. We consider a model of olfactory bulb containing populations
of excitatory mitral and inhibitory granule cells. We argue that sparse codes
may emerge as a result of self organization in the network leading to the
precise balance between mitral cells' excitatory inputs and inhibition provided
by the granule cells. We propose a novel role for the olfactory granule cells.
We show that these cells can build representations of odorant stimuli that are
not fully accurate. Due to the incompleteness in the granule cell
representation, the exact excitation-inhibition balance is established only for
some mitral cells leading to sparse responses of the mitral cell. Our model
suggests a functional significance to the dendrodendritic synapses that mediate
interactions between mitral and granule cells. The model accounts for the
sparse olfactory code in the steady state and predicts that transient dynamics
may be less sparse.

if spatial distributions must be taken into account. Especially the cytoplasm
has a very complex geometric structure which cannot be handled by standard
discretization techniques. In the present paper we propose a homogenization
technique for computing effective diffusion constants. This is accomplished by
using a two-step strategy. The first step consists of an analytic
homogenization from the smallest to an intermediate scale. The homogenization
error is estimated by comparing the analytic diffusion constant with a
numerical estimate obtained by using real cell geometries. The second step
consists of a random homogenization. Since no analytical solution is known to
this homogenization problem, a numerical approximation algorithm is proposed.
Although rather expensive this algorithm provides a reasonable estimate of the
homogenized diffusion constant.

relative abundance of species within a natural community. The proper
application of the principles of statistical physics to the problem of species
abundance distributions (SADs) has enabled us to identify the fundamental
ecological principles responsible for the near universal features observed.
These principles are (i) a limit on the number of individuals in an ecological
guild and (ii) per capita birth and death rates. We thus unify the neutral
theory of Hubbell [1], the master equation approach of Volkov et al [2, 3] and
a recent attempt at deploying statistical mechanics to deal with this problem,
the idiosyncratic [extreme niche] theory of Pueyo et al [4]; we have identified
the true origin of the prior in [4]. We also find in our results clear
indications that niches must be very flexible and that temporal fluctuations on
all sorts of scales are of considerable importance in community structure.

  579-604</journal-ref><license>http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/</license><abstract>  In this paper, we introduce an approach to the protein folding problem from
the point of view of statistical physics. Protein folding is a stochastic
process by which a polypeptide folds into its characteristic and functional 3D
structure from random coil. The process involves an intricate interplay between
global geometry and local structure, and each protein seems to present special
problems. We introduce CSAW (conditioned self-avoiding walk), a model of
protein folding that combines the features of self-avoiding walk (SAW) and the
Monte Carlo method. In this model, the unfolded protein chain is treated as a
random coil described by SAW. Folding is induced by hydrophobic forces and
other interactions, such as hydrogen bonding, which can be taken into account
by imposing conditions on SAW. Conceptually, the mathematical basis is a
generalized Langevin equation. To illustrate the flexibility and capabilities
of the model, we consider several examples, including helix formation, elastic
properties, and the transition in the folding of myoglobin. From the CSAW
simulation and physical arguments, we find a universal elastic energy for
proteins, which depends only on the radius of gyration $R_{g}$ and the residue
number $N$. The elastic energy gives rise to scaling laws $R_{g}\sim N^{\nu}$
in different regions with exponents $\nu =3/5,3/7,2/5$, consistent with the
observed unfolded stage, pre-globule, and molten globule, respectively. These
results indicate that CSAW can serve as a theoretical laboratory to study
universal principles in protein folding.

$R_{g}\sim N^{\nu}$ in different regions. It shows three folding stages
characterized by the progression with exponents $\nu = 3/5, 3/7, 2/5$, which we
identify as the unfolded stage, pre-globule, and molten globule, respectively.
The pre-globule goes over to the molten globule via a break in behavior akin to
a first-order phase transition, which is initiated by a sudden acceleration of
hydrogen bonding.

defines the most likely probability distribution of observations taken from
that measurement scale. Our approach extends the method of maximum entropy to
use measurement scale as a type of information constraint. We argue that a very
common measurement scale is linear at small magnitudes grading into logarithmic
at large magnitudes, leading to observations that often follow Student's
probability distribution which has a Gaussian shape for small fluctuations from
the mean and a power law shape for large fluctuations from the mean. An inverse
scaling often arises in which measures naturally grade from logarithmic to
linear as one moves from small to large magnitudes, leading to observations
that often follow a gamma probability distribution. A gamma distribution has a
power law shape for small magnitudes and an exponential shape for large
magnitudes. The two measurement scales are natural inverses connected by the
Laplace integral transform. This inversion connects the two major scaling
patterns commonly found in nature. We also show that superstatistics is a
special case of an integral transform, and thus can be understood as a
particular way in which to change the scale of measurement. Incorporating
information about measurement scale into maximum entropy provides a general
approach to the relations between measurement, information and probability.

complex networks. There are two kinds of players: cooperators and defectors.
Cooperators pay a benefit b to their neighbors at a cost c, whereas defectors
only receive a benefit. The game is a death-birth process with weak selection.
Although it has been widely thought that b/c&gt; &lt;k&gt; is a condition of favoring
cooperation, we find that b/c&gt; &lt;knn&gt; is the condition. We also show that among
three representative networks, namely, regular, random, and scale-free, a
regular network favors cooperation the most whereas a scale-free network favors
cooperation the least. In an ideal scale-free network, cooperation is never
realized. Whether or not the scale-free network and network heterogeneity favor
cooperation depends on the details of the game, although it is occasionally
believed that these favor cooperation irrespective of the game structure.

networked dynamical system. Knockout resilience in the dynamics of the
remaining nodes is a sign of robustness. Here we study the effect of knockouts
for binary state sequences and their implementations in terms of Boolean
threshold networks. Beside random sequences with biologically plausible
constraints, we analyze the cell cycle sequence of the species Saccharomyces
cerevisiae and the Boolean networks implementing it. Comparing with an
appropriate null model we do not find evidence that the yeast wildtype network
is optimized for high knockout resilience. Our notion of knockout resilience
weakly correlates with the size of the basin of attraction, which has also been
considered a measure of robustness.

evolution of a population in a patchy environment, focusing on whether a
population already established in one patch either successfully invades an
adjacent empty patch or undergoes a global in-all-patch extinction. Our study
is based on the combination of analytical and numerical results for both a
deterministic two-patch model and its stochastic analog. The deterministic
model has either two or four attractors. In the presence of weak dispersal, the
analysis of the deterministic model shows that a high-density and a low-density
populations can coexist at equilibrium in nearby patches, whereas the analysis
of the stochastic model indicates that this equilibrium is metastable, thus
leading after a large random time to either an in-all-patch expansion or an
in-all-patch extinction. Up to some critical dispersal, increasing the
intensity of the interactions leads to an increase of both the basin of
attraction of the in-all-patch extinction and the basin of attraction of the
in-all-patch expansion. Above this threshold, while increasing the intensity of
the dispersal, both deterministic and stochastic models predict a
synchronization of the patches resulting in either a global expansion or a
global extinction: for the deterministic model, two of the four attractors
present when the dispersal is weak are lost, while the stochastic model no
longer exhibits a metastable behavior. In the presence of strong dispersal, the
limiting behavior is entirely determined by the value of the Allee threshold as
the global population size in the deterministic and the stochastic two-patch
models evolves as dictated by the single-patch counterparts ...

multiple testing problems. It is defined as the expected False Discovery
Proportion (FDP), that is, the expected fraction of false positives among
rejected hypotheses. When the hypotheses are independent, the
Benjamini-Hochberg procedure achieves FDR control at any pre-specified level.
By construction, FDR control offers no guarantee in terms of power, or type II
error. A number of alternative procedures have been developed, including
plug-in procedures that aim at gaining power by incorporating an estimate of
the proportion of true null hypotheses. In this paper, we study the asymptotic
behavior of a class of plug-in procedures based on kernel estimators of the
density of the $p$-values, as the number $m$ of tested hypotheses grows to
infinity. In a setting where the hypotheses tested are independent, we prove
that these procedures are asymptotically more powerful in two respects: (i) a
tighter asymptotic FDR control for any target FDR level and (ii) a broader
range of target levels yielding positive asymptotic power. We also show that
this increased asymptotic power comes at the price of slower, non-parametric
convergence rates for the FDP. These rates are of the form $m^{-k/(2k+1)}$,
where $k$ is determined by the regularity of the density of the $p$-value
distribution, or, equivalently, of the test statistics distribution. These
results are applied to one- and two-sided tests statistics for Gaussian and
Laplace location models, and for the Student model.

the viewpoint of diffusion theory. The cytoplasm plays a role of a medium for
stochastic motion of the virus contained in the endosome as well as the free
virus. It is experimentally known that the exponent of anomalous diffusion
fluctuates in localized areas of the cytoplasm. Here, generalizing fractional
kinetic theory, such fluctuations are described in terms of the exponent
locally distributed over the cytoplasm, and a theoretical proposition is
presented for its statistical form. The proposed fluctuations may be examined
in an experiment of heterogeneous diffusion in the infection pathway.

semi circular canals (SSC) of idiopathic scoliosis (IS) we found severe
anomalies mainly located in lateral SCC devoted to trunk rotation and lateral
deviations. We also found a specific communication between the lateral and
posterior canal involving the utricular chamber which is also highly suspected
in scoliosis. Key points: - Membranous semi circular canals (SCC) modelling
based on MRI revealed significant anomalies in IS patients compared to normal
subjects. - Frequent aplasias located in the lateral canal were found in IS. -
We also discovered a, never described, abnormal communication between lateral
and posterior canal. - Lateral SCC is involved in trunk rotation and lateral
deviation: these movements are frequently abnormal in IS. Supports: Fondation

determining phenotypes. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and similar
statistical studies of linkage data, however, assume additive models of gene
interactions in looking for genotype-phenotype associations. These statistical
methods view the compound effects of multiple genes on a phenotype as a sum of
partial influences of each individual gene and can often miss a substantial
part of the heritable effect. Such methods do not use any biological knowledge
about underlying genotype-phenotype mechanisms. Modeling approaches from the AI
field that incorporate deterministic knowledge into models to perform
statistical analysis can be applied to include prior knowledge in genetic
analysis. We chose to use the most general such approach, Markov Logic Networks
(MLNs), as a framework for combining deterministic knowledge with statistical
analysis. Using simple, logistic regression-type MLNs we have been able to
replicate the results of traditional statistical methods. Moreover, we show
that even with simple models we are able to go beyond finding independent
markers linked to a phenotype by using joint inference that avoids an
independence assumption. The method is applied to genetic data on yeast
sporulation, a phenotype governed by non-linear gene interactions. In addition
to detecting all of the previously identified loci associated with sporulation,
our method is able to identify four loci with small effects. Since their effect
on sporulation is small, these four loci were not detected with methods that do
not account for dependence between markers due to gene interactions. We show
how gene interactions can be detected using more complex models, which can be
used as a general framework for incorporating systems biology with genetics.

large, rare stochastic fluctuation. Although the extinction process is
dynamically unstable, it follows an optimal path that maximizes the probability
of extinction. We show that the optimal path is also directly related to the
finite-time Lyapunov exponents of the underlying dynamical system in that the
optimal path displays maximum sensitivity to initial conditions. We consider
several stochastic epidemic models, and examine the extinction process in a
dynamical systems framework. Using the dynamics of the finite-time Lyapunov
exponents as a constructive tool, we demonstrate that the dynamical systems
viewpoint of extinction evolves naturally toward the optimal path.

synaptic weights of an Ising perceptron are studied. In this process, binary
patterns are sequentially presented to the Ising perceptron and are then
learned as the synaptic weight configuration is modified through a chain of
single- or double-weight flips within the compatible weight configuration space
of the earlier learned patterns. This process is able to reach a storage
capacity of $\alpha \approx 0.63$ for pattern length N = 101 and $\alpha
\approx 0.41$ for N = 1001. If in addition a relearning process is exploited,
the learning performance is further improved to a storage capacity of $\alpha
\approx 0.80$ for N = 101 and $\alpha \approx 0.42$ for N=1001. We found that,
for a given learning task, the solutions constructed by the random walk
learning process are separated by a typical Hamming distance, which decreases
with the constraint density $\alpha$ of the learning task; at a fixed value of
$\alpha$, the width of the Hamming distance distributions decreases with $N$.

  Th1-Th2-Treg Interactions</title><categories>q-bio.CB q-bio.PE</categories><license>http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/</license><abstract>  Regulatory T cells (Treg) have recently been identified as playing a central
role in allergy and during allergen-specific immunotherapy. We have extended
our previous mathematical model describing the nonlinear dynamics of Th1-Th2
regulation by including Treg cells and their major cytokines. We hypothesize
that immunotherapy mainly acts on the T cell level and that the decisive
process can be regarded as a dynamical phenomenon. The model consists of
nonlinear differential equations which describe the proliferation and mutual
suppression of different T cell subsets. The old version of the model was based
upon the Th1-Th2 paradigm and is successful in describing the "Th1-Th2 switch"
which was considered the decisive event during specific immunotherapy. In
recent years, however, the Th1-Th2 paradigm has been questioned and therefore,
we have investigated a modified model in order to account for the influence of
a regulatory T cell type. We examined the extended model by means of numerical
simulations and analytical methods. As the modified model is more complex, we
had to develop new methods to portray its characteristics. The concept of
stable manifolds of fixed points of a stroboscobic map turned out to be
especially important. We found that when including regulatory T cells, our
model can describe the events in allergen-specific immunotherapy more
accurately. Our results suggest that the decisive effect of immunotherapy, the
increased proliferation of Treg and suppression of Th2 cells, crucially depends
on the administration of high dose injections right before the maintenance
phase sets in. Empirical protocols could therefore be improved by optimizing
this step of therapy.

receptor populations are examined via non-parametric statistical measures of
species overlap and diversity borrowed from ecological studies. While this
approach is robust in a wide range of situations, it seems to provide little
insight into the underlying clonal size distribution and the overall mechanism
differentiating the receptor populations. As a possible alternative, the
current paper presents a parametric method which adjusts for the data
under-sampling as well as provides a unifying approach to simultaneous
comparison of multiple receptor groups by means of the modern statistical tools
of unsupervised learning. The parametric model is based on a flexible
multivariate Poisson-lognormal distribution and is seen to be a natural
generalization of the univariate Poisson-lognormal models used in ecological
studies of biodiversity patterns. The procedure for evaluating model's fit is
described along with the public domain software developed to perform the
necessary diagnostics. The model-driven analysis is seen to compare favorably
vis a vis traditional methods when applied to the data from T-cell receptors in
transgenic mice populations.

fundamental biological processes including folding, misfolding, and mechanical
unraveling of biomolecules, under physiologically relevant conditions, is
challenging even for distributed computing systems. Graphics Processing Units
(GPUs) are emerging as an alternative programming platform to the more
traditional CPUs as they provide high raw computational power that can be
utilized in a wide range of scientific applications. Using a coarse-grained
Self Organized Polymer (SOP) model, we have developed and tested the GPU-based
implementation of Langevin simulations for proteins (SOP-GPU program).
Simultaneous calculation of forces for all particles is implemented using
either the particle based or the interacting pair based parallelization, which
leads to a ~30-fold acceleration compared to an optimized CPU version of the
program. We assess the computational performance of an end-to-end application
of the SOP-GPU program, where all steps of the algorithm are running on the
GPU, by profiling the associated simulation time and memory usage for a number
of small proteins, long protein fibers, and large-size protein assemblies. The
SOP-GPU package can now be used in the theoretical exploration of the
mechanical properties of large-size protein systems to generate the
force-extension and force-indentation profiles under the experimental
conditions of force application, and to relate the results of single-molecule
experiments in vitro and in silico.

behavior of stochastic neural networks. Dynamical mean field equations were
derived for such networks by taking the average of two stochastic variables: a
firing state variable and a synaptic variable. In these equations, their
average product is decoupled as the product of averaged them because the two
stochastic variables are independent. We proved the independence of these two
stochastic variables assuming that the synaptic weight is of the order of 1/N
with respect to the number of neurons N. Using these equations, we derived
macroscopic steady state equations for a network with uniform connections and a
ring attractor network with Mexican hat type connectivity and investigated the
stability of the steady state solutions. An oscillatory uniform state was
observed in the network with uniform connections due to a Hopf instability.
With the ring network, high-frequency perturbations were shown not to affect
system stability. Two mechanisms destabilize the inhomogeneous steady state,
leading two oscillatory states. A Turing instability leads to a rotating bump
state, while a Hopf instability leads to an oscillatory bump state, which was
previous unreported. Various oscillatory states take place in a network with
synaptic depression depending on the strength of the interneuron connections.

might disagree with the containing species tree. The primary causes of gene
tree and species tree discord include lineage sorting, horizontal gene
transfer, and gene duplication and loss. Each of these events yields a
different parsimony criterion for inferring the (containing) species tree from
gene trees. With lineage sorting, species tree inference is to find the tree
minimizing extra gene lineages that had to coexist along species lineages; with
gene duplication, it becomes to find the tree minimizing gene duplications
and/or losses. In this paper, we show the following results: (i) The deep
coalescence cost is equal to the number of gene losses minus two times the gene
duplication cost in the reconciliation of a uniquely leaf labeled gene tree and
a species tree. The deep coalescence cost can be computed in linear time for
any arbitrary gene tree and species tree. (ii) The deep coalescence cost is
always no less than the gene duplication cost in the reconciliation of an
arbitrary gene tree and a species tree. (iii) Species tree inference by
minimizing deep coalescences is NP-hard.

Many systems show
multiple such (positive or negative) feedback loops. Nevertheless, very few
quantitative analyses address the question how such multiple feedback loops
evolved. Based on published models from the mitotic cycle in embryogenesis, we
build a few case studies. Using a simple core architecture (transcription,
phosphorylation and degradation), we define oscillatory models having either
one positive feedback or one negative feedback, or both loops. With these
models, we address the following questions about evolvability: could a system
evolve from a simple model to a more complex one with a continuous transition
in the parameter space? How do new feedback loops emerge without disrupting the
proper function of the system? Our results show that progressive formation of a
second feedback loop is possible without disturbing existing oscillatory
behavior. For this process, the parameters of the system have to change during
evolution to maintain predefined properties of oscillations like period and
amplitude.

Eigen's error threshold. Presumably, enzymatic replication can maintain higher
complexity, but in a competitive environment such a replicator is faced with
two problems related to its twofold role as enzyme and substrate: as enzyme, it
should replicate itself rather than wastefully copy non-functional substrates,
and as substrate it should preferably be replicated by superior enzymes instead
of less-efficient mutants. Because specific recognition can enforce these
propensities, we thoroughly analyze an idealized quasispecies model for
enzymatic replication, with replication rates that are either a decreasing
(self-specific) or increasing (cross-specific) function of the Hamming distance
between the recognition or "tag" sequences of enzyme and substrate. We find
that very weak self-specificity suffices to localize a population about a
master sequence and thus to preserve its information, while simultaneous
localization about complementary sequences in the cross-specific case is more
challenging. A surprising result is that stronger specificity constraints allow
longer recognition sequences, because the populations are better localized.
Extrapolating from experimental data, we obtain rough quantitative estimates
for the maximal length of the recognition or tag sequence that can be used to
reliably discriminate appropriate and infeasible enzymes and substrates,
respectively.

the dynamics and structure of aquatic communities. Here, using an
advection-reaction-diffusion model, we investigate the distribution and
competition of phytoplankton species in a water column, in which inverse
resource gradients of light and a nutrient can limit growth of the biomass.
This problem poses a challenge for ecologists, as the location of a production
layer is not fixed, but rather depends on many internal parameters and
environmental factors. In particular, we study the influence of an upper mixed
layer (UML) in this system and show that it leads to a variety of dynamic
effects: (i) Our model predicts alternative density profiles with a maximum of
biomass either within or below the UML, thereby the system may be bistable or
the relaxation from an unstable state may require a long-lasting transition.
(ii) Reduced mixing in the deep layer can induce oscillations of the biomass;
we show that a UML can sustain these oscillations even if the diffusivity is
less than the critical mixing for a sinking phytoplankton population. (iii) A
UML can strongly modify the outcome of competition between different
phytoplankton species, yielding bistability both in the spatial distribution
and in the species composition. (iv) A light limited species can obtain a
competitive advantage if the diffusivity in the deep layers is reduced below a
critical value. This yields a subtle competitive exclusion effect, where the
oscillatory states in the deep layers are displaced by steady solutions in the
UML. Finally, we present a novel graphical approach for deducing the
competition outcome and for the analysis of the role of a UML in aquatic
systems.

  Requires Kinetic Proofreading</title><categories>q-bio.CB physics.bio-ph</categories><comments>29 pages, 11 figures</comments><license>http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/</license><abstract>  B cells signaling in response to antigen is proportional to antigen affinity,
a process known as affinity discrimination. Recent research suggests that B
cells can acquire antigen in membrane-bound form on the surface of
antigen-presenting cells (APCs), with signaling being initiated within a few
seconds of B cell/APC contact. During the earliest stages of B cell/APC
contact, B cell receptors (BCRs) on protrusions of the B cell surface bind to
antigen on the APC surface and form micro-clusters of 10-100 BCR/Antigen
complexes. In this study, we use computational modeling to show that B cell
affinity discrimination at the level of BCR-antigen micro-clusters requires a
threshold antigen binding time, in a manner similar to kinetic proofreading. We
find that if BCR molecules become signaling-capable immediately upon binding
antigen, there is a loss in serial engagement due to the increase in bond
lifetime as koff decreases. This results in decreasing signaling strength as
affinity increases. A threshold time for antigen to stay bound to BCR before
the latter becomes signaling-capable favors high affinity BCR-antigen bonds, as
these long-lived bonds can better fulfill the threshold time requirement than
low-affinity bonds. A threshold antigen binding time of ~10 seconds results in
monotonically increasing signaling with affinity, replicating the affinity
discrimination pattern observed in B cell activation experiments. This time
matches well (within order of magnitude) with the experimentally observed time
(~ 20 seconds) required for the BCR signaling domains to undergo antigen and
lipid raft-mediated conformational changes that lead to association with Syk.

are formulated with fractional order differential equations. Different models
are proposed depending on the timing of the chemotactic forcing.
Generalizations of the models to include linear reaction dynamics are also
derived. Finally a Monte Carlo method for simulating anomalous subdiffusion
with chemotaxis is introduced and simulation results are compared with
numerical solutions of the model equations. The model equations developed here
could be used to replace Keller-Segel type equations in biological systems with

behavior of large heterogeneous ensembles subject to ecological forces like
dispersal remains a central challenge for mathematicians and biological
scientists alike. Over the past century, specific attention has been directed
to the role played by dispersal in shaping plant communities, or on the
dynamics of marine open-ocean and intertidal systems, or on biological
invasions, or on the spread of disease, to name a few. Mathematicians and
theoreticians, starting with the efforts of researchers that include Aronson,
Fisher, Kolmogorov, Levin, Okubo, Skellam, Slobodkin, Weinberger and many
others, set the foundation of a fertile area of research at the interface of
ecology, mathematics, population biology and evolutionary biology.
Integrodifference systems, the subject of this manuscript, arise naturally in
the study of the spatial dispersal of organisms whose local population dynamics
are prescribed by models with discrete generations. The brunt of the
mathematical research has focused on the the study of existence traveling wave
solutions and characterizations of the spreading speed particularly, in the
context of cooperative systems. In this paper, we characterize the spreading
speed for a large class of non cooperative systems, all formulated in terms of
integrodifference equations, by the convergence of initial data to wave
solutions. In this setting, the spreading speed is characterized as the slowest
speed of a family of non-constant traveling wave solutions. Our results are
applied to a specific non-cooperative competition system in detail.

distribution of species and effects such as demographic stochasticity,
immigration fluxes, and the existence of preferred habitats. We introduce an
individual-based model describing the competition of two species and
incorporating all the above ingredients. We find that the presence of habitat
preference --- generating spatial niches --- strongly stabilizes the
coexistence of the two species. Eliminating habitat preference --- neutral
dynamics --- the model generates patterns, such as distribution of population
sizes, practically identical to those obtained in the presence of habitat
preference, provided an higher immigration rate is considered. Notwithstanding
the similarity in the population distribution, we show that invasibility
properties depend on habitat preference in a non-trivial way. In particular,
the neutral model results results more invasible or less invasible depending on
whether the comparison is made at equal immigration rate or at equal
distribution of population size, respectively. We discuss the relevance of
these results for the interpretation of invasibility experiments and the
species occupancy of preferred habitats.

solution for a long-standing problem in theoretical ecology, the so-called
"savanna problem". The challenge is to understand why in savanna ecosystems
trees and grasses coexist in a robust way with large spatio-temporal
variability. We propose a simple model, a variant of the Contact Process (CP),
which includes two key extra features: varying external
(environmental/rainfall) conditions and tree age. The system fluctuates locally
between a woodland and a grassland phase, corresponding to the active and
absorbing phases of the underlying pure contact process. This leads to a highly
variable stable phase characterized by patches of the woodland and grassland
phases coexisting dynamically. We show that the mean time to tree extinction
under this model increases as a power-law of system size and can be of the
order of 10,000,000 years in even moderately sized savannas. Finally, we
demonstrate that while local interactions among trees may influence tree
spatial distribution and the order of the transition between woodland and
grassland phases, they do not affect dynamical coexistence. We expect dynamical
coexistence to be relevant in other contexts in physics, biology or the social
sciences.

and robustness despite its inability to model specific cohort effects. A large
number of extensions have been proposed that model cohort effects but there is
no consensus. It is difficult to simultaneously account for cohort effects and
age-adjusted improvements and we here test a simple model that accounts for
both: we simply add a non age-adjusted cohort component to the Lee Carter
framework. This is a trade-off between accuracy and robustness but, for various
countries present in the Human Mortality Database and compared to various
models, the model accurately fits past mortality data and gives good
backtesting projections.

auditory, sensational, and motor mappings in the forebrain. How and why did
these evolve? The few theories to this question provide functional answers,
such as better networks for visuomotor control. However, these theories
contradict the data, as discussed here. Instead we propose that a 90-deg
left-turn around the body-axis evolved in a common ancestor of all vertebrates.
Compensatory migrations of the tissues during development restore body
symmetry. Eyes, nostrils and forebrain compensate in the direction of the turn,
whereas more caudal structures migrate in the opposite direction. As a result
of these opposite migrations the forebrain becomes crossed and inverted with
respect to the rest of the nervous system. We show that these compensatory
migratory movements can indeed be observed in the zebrafish (Danio rerio) and
the chick (Gallus gallus). With a model we show how the axial twist hypothesis
predicts that an optic chiasm should develop on the ventral side of the brain,
whereas the olfactory tract should be uncrossed. In addition, the hypothesis
explains the decussation of the trochlear nerve, why olfaction is non-crossed,
why the cerebellar hemispheres represent the ipsilateral bodyside, why in
sharks the forebrain halves each represent the ipsilateral eye, why the heart
and other inner organs are asymmetric in the body. Due to the poor fossil
record, the possible evolutionary scenarios remain speculative. Molecular
evidence does support the hypothesis. The findings may throw new insight on the
problematic structure of the forebrain.

epigenetic alterations in a single cell. Mutations that confer a fitness
advantage to the cell are known as driver mutations and are causally related to
tumorigenesis. Other mutations, however, do not change the phenotype of the
cell or even decrease cellular fitness. While much experimental effort is being
devoted to the identification of the different functional effects of individual
mutations, mathematical modeling of tumor progression generally considers
constant fitness increments as mutations are accumulated. In this paper we
study a mathematical model of tumor progression with random fitness increments.
We analyze a multi-type branching process in which cells accumulate mutations
whose fitness effects are chosen from a distribution. We determine the effect
of the fitness distribution on the growth kinetics of the tumor. This work
contributes to a quantitative understanding of the accumulation of mutations
leading to cancer phenotypes.

life to lie significantly deeper in chaos than Kauffman approach does, however
still in boundary area near `the edge of chaos and order'. The role of negative
feedbacks in stability of living objects is main of those reasons. In
Kauffman's approach regulation using negative feedbacks is not considered
sufficiently, e.g. in gene regulatory model based on Boolean networks, which
indicates therefore not proper source of stability. Large damage avalanche is
available only in chaotic phase. It models death in all living objects
necessary for Darwinian elimination. It is the first step of my approach
leading to structural tendencies which are effects of adaptive evolution of
dynamic complex (maturely chaotic) networks. 2- Introduction of s&gt;=2 equally
probable variants of signal (state of node in Kauffman network) as
interpretively based new statistical mechanism (RSN) instead of the bias p -
probability of one of signal variants used in RBN family and RNS. It is also
different than RWN model. For this mechanism which can be treated as very
frequent, ordered phase occurs only in exceptional cases but for this approach
the chaotic phase is investigated. Annealed approximation expectations and
simulations of damage spreading for different network types (similar to CRBN,
FSRBN and EFRBN but with s&gt;=2) are described. Degree of order in chaotic phase
in dependency of network parameters and type is discussed. By using such order
life evolve. 3- A simplified algorithm called `reversed-annealed' for
statistical simulation of damage spreading is described. It is used for
simulations presented in this and next papers describing my approach.

in many of the processes known or predicted to be disrupted in PD. We suggest
that circulating blood cells in PD patients can be in a full-blown

likewise confined in a narrow channel show a generic upstream flux in

Here we
consider a structure to be tantamount to the noncrossing Watson-Crick and
\pairGU-base pairings (secondary structure) and additional cross-serial base
pairs. These interactions are called pseudoknots and are observed across the
whole spectrum of RNA functionalities. In the context of studying natural RNA
structures, searching for new ribozymes and designing artificial RNA, it is of
interest to find RNA sequences folding into a specific structure and to analyze
their induced neutral networks. Since the established inverse folding
algorithms, {\tt RNAinverse}, {\tt RNA-SSD} as well as {\tt INFO-RNA} are
limited to RNA secondary structures, we present in this paper the inverse
folding algorithm {\tt Inv} which can deal with 3-noncrossing, canonical
pseudoknot structures.
  Results: In this paper we present the inverse folding algorithm {\tt Inv}. We
give a detailed analysis of {\tt Inv}, including pseudocodes. We show that {\tt
Inv} allows to design in particular 3-noncrossing nonplanar RNA pseudoknot
3-noncrossing RNA structures--a class which is difficult to construct via
dynamic programming routines. {\tt Inv} is freely available at
\url{http://www.combinatorics.cn/cbpc/inv.html}.
  Conclusions: The algorithm {\tt Inv} extends inverse folding capabilities to
RNA pseudoknot structures. In comparison with {\tt RNAinverse} it uses new
ideas, for instance by considering sets of competing structures. As a result,
{\tt Inv} is not only able to find novel sequences even for RNA secondary
structures, it does so in the context of competing structures that potentially
exhibit cross-serial interactions.

shoals of fish and flocks of birds) to microscopic scales (e.g. migrating
cells, motile bacteria and gels formed through the interaction of nanoscale
molecular motors with cytoskeletal filaments within cells). Such systems are
often idealizable in terms of collections of individual units, referred to as
active particles or self-propelled particles, which take energy from an
internal replenishable energy depot or ambient medium and transduce it into
useful work performed on the environment, in addition to dissipating a fraction
of this energy into heat. These individual units may interact both directly as
well as through disturbances propagated via the medium in which they are
immersed. Active particles can exhibit remarkable collective behaviour as a
consequence of these interactions, including non-equilibrium phase transitions
between novel dynamical phases, large fluctuations violating expectations from
the central limit theorem and substantial robustness against the disordering
effects of thermal fluctuations. In this chapter, following a brief summary of
experimental systems which may be classified as examples of active matter, I
describe some of the principles which underlie the modeling of such systems.

taking into account the influence of each species on the carrying capacities of
the others. The modeled entities can pertain to biological and ecological
societies or to social, economic and financial societies. Our model includes
three basic types: symbiosis with direct mutual interactions, symbiosis with
asymmetric interactions, and symbiosis without direct interactions. In all
cases, we provide a complete classification of all admissible dynamical
regimes. The proposed model of symbiosis turned out to be very rich, as it
exhibits four qualitatively different regimes: convergence to stationary
states, unbounded exponential growth, finite-time singularity, and finite-time
death or extinction of species.

cortical activity currently paraphrased as cortical Up/Down states. A recent
experiment demonstrated a bistable collective behaviour in ferret slices, with
the remarkable property that the Up states can be switched on and off with
pulses, or excitations, of same polarity; whereby the effect of the second
pulse significantly depends on the time interval between the pulses. Here we
present a simple time discrete model of a neural network that exhibits this
type of behaviour, as well as quantitatively reproduces the time-dependence
found in the experiments.

population dynamics in particular to some properties of the multi-step from
healthy tissue to fully malignant tumours. Recent evidence shows that diversity
within the cell population of a neoplasm, a pre-tumoural lession that can
develop into a fully malignant tumour, is the best predictor for its evolving
into a tumour. By studying the dynamics of a population described by a
multi-type, population-size limited branching process in terms of the
evolutionary formalism, we show some general principles regarding the
probability of a resident population to being invaded by a mutant population in
terms of the number of types present in the population and their resilience. We
show that, although diversity in the mutant population poses a barrier for the
emergence of the initial (benign) lession, under appropiate conditions, namely,
the phenotypes in the mutant population being more resilient than those of the
resident population, a more variable noeplastic population is more likely to be
invaded by a more malignant one. Analysis of a model of gene regulatory
networks suggest possible mechanisms giving rise to mutants with increased
phenotypic diversity and robustness. We then go on to show how these results
may help us to interpret some recent data regarding the evolution of Barrett's
oesophagus into throat cancer.

  Finding Genes that Matter</title><categories>stat.ME math.ST q-bio.QM stat.TH</categories><license>http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/</license><abstract>  High-throughput scientific studies involving no clear a'priori hypothesis are
common. For example, a large-scale genomic study of a disease may examine
thousands of genes without hypothesizing that any specific gene is responsible
for the disease. In these studies, the objective is to explore a large number
of possible factors (e.g. genes) in order to identify a small number that will
be considered in follow-up studies that tend to be more thorough and on smaller
scales. For large-scale studies, we propose a nonparametric Bayesian approach
based on random partition models. Our model thus divides the set of candidate
factors into several subgroups according to their degrees of relevance, or
potential effect, in relation to the outcome of interest. The model allows for
a latent rank to be assigned to each factor according to the overall potential
importance of its corresponding group. The posterior expectation or mode of
these ranks is used to set up a threshold for selecting potentially relevant
factors. Using simulated data, we demonstrate that our approach could be quite
effective in finding relevant genes compared to several alternative methods. We
apply our model to two large-scale studies. The first study involves
transcriptome analysis of infection by human cytomegalovirus (HCMV). The
objective of the second study is to identify differentially expressed genes
between two types of leukemia.

  dynamics</title><categories>q-bio.PE</categories><license>http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/</license><abstract>  Dynamical mechanisms that can stabilize the coexistence or diversity in
biology are generally of fundamental interest. In contrast to many two-strategy
evolutionary games, games with three strategies and cyclic dominance like the
rock-paper-scissors game (RPS) stabilize coexistence and thus preserve
biodiversity in this system. In the limit of infinite populations, resembling
the traditional picture of evolutionary game theory, replicator equations
predict the existence of a fixed point in the interior of the phase space. But
in finite populations, strategy frequencies will run out of the fixed point
because of stochastic fluctuations, and strategies can even go extinct. For
three different processes and for zero-sum and non-zero-sum RPS as well, we
present results of extensive simulations for the mean extinction time (MET),
depending on the number of agents N, and we introduce two analytical approaches
for the derivation of the MET.

The nature of

according to which birds literally `see' the local magnetic field: Our model
relates the well-established radical pair hypothesis to the phenomenon of
Haidinger's brush, a capacity to see the polarisation of light. This new
picture explains recent surprising experimental data indicating long lifetimes
for the radical pair. Moreover there is a clear evolutionary path toward this
field sensing mechanism: it is an enhancement of a weak effect that may be
present in many species.

approximate the occupancy distribution of a set of states in a homogeneous but

properties satisfied by this coefficient, which allow us to approximate a chain
of duration n by independent and short-lived realizations of an auxiliary
homogeneous Markov chain of duration of order ln(n). Our approximation may be
particularly useful when exact calculations via first-step methods or transfer
matrices are impractical, and asymptotic approximations may not be yet
reliable. Our findings may find applications to pattern problems in Markovian
and non-Markovian sequences that are treatable via embedding techniques.

connected subgraphs in the protein-protein interactome (PPI). Proteins are
often involved in multiple biological pathways which complicates interpretation
of interactions between proteins. Gene expression data can assist our inference
since genes within a particular pathway tend to have more correlated expression
patterns than genes from distinct pathways. We provide an algorithm that uses
gene expression information to remove inter-pathway protein-protein
interactions, thereby simplifying the structure of the protein-protein
interactome. This refined topology permits easier interpretation and greater
biological coherence of multiple biological pathways simultaneously.

that can account for both the discrete and stochastic nature of chemical
interactions as well as spatial inhomogeneities and diffusion. This is
particularly true in biology and nanoscale materials science, where the common
assumptions of deterministic dynamics and well-mixed reaction volumes often
break down. In this article, we present a spatial version of the
partitioned-leaping algorithm (PLA), a multiscale accelerated-stochastic
simulation approach built upon the tau-leaping framework of Gillespie. We pay
special attention to the details of the implementation, particularly as it
pertains to the time step calculation procedure. We point out conceptual errors
that have been made in this regard in prior implementations of spatial
tau-leaping and illustrate the manifestation of these errors through practical
examples. Finally, we discuss the fundamental difficulties associated with
incorporating efficient exact-stochastic techniques, such as the next-subvolume
method, into a spatial-leaping framework and suggest possible solutions.

electroencephalography (EEG) based Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCI): one feature
based on multifractal cumulants, and one feature based on the predictive
complexity of the EEG time series. The multifractal cumulants feature measures
the signal regularity, while the predictive complexity measures the difficulty
to predict the future of the signal based on its past, hence a degree of how
complex it is. We have conducted an evaluation of the performance of these two
novel features on EEG data corresponding to motor-imagery. We also compared
them to the most successful features used in the BCI field, namely the
Band-Power features. We evaluated these three kinds of features and their
combinations on EEG signals from 13 subjects. Results obtained show that our
novel features can lead to BCI designs with improved classification
performance, notably when using and combining the three kinds of feature
(band-power, multifractal cumulants, predictive complexity) together.

strategies) are of substantial interest for the maintenance of biodiversity and
in sociobehavioural dynamics. We investigate the mean extinction time in the
coevolutionary dynamics of three cyclically invading strategies for different
evolutionary processes on various classes of complex networks, including random
graphs, scale-free and small world networks. We find that scale-free and random
graphs lead to a strong stabilization of coexistence both for the Moran process
and the Local Update process. The stabilization is of an order of magnitude
stronger compared to a lattice topology, and is mainly caused by the degree
heterogeneity of the graph. However, evolutionary processes on graphs can be
defined in many variants, and we show that in a process using effective payoffs
the effect of the network topology can be completely reversed. Thus,
stabilization of coexistence depends on both network geometry and underlying
evolutionary process.

understand also the natural environment it evolved to interpret. Unfortunately,
existing models of the visual environment are either unrealistic or too complex
for mathematical description. Here we describe a naturalistic image model and
present a mathematical solution for the statistical relationships between the
image features and model variables. The world described by this model is
composed of independent, opaque, textured objects which occlude each other.
This simple structure allows us to calculate the joint probability distribution
of image values sampled at multiple arbitrarily located points, without
approximation. This result can be converted into probabilistic relationships
between observable image features as well as between the unobservable
properties that caused these features, including object boundaries and relative
depth. Using these results we explain the causes of a wide range of natural
scene properties, including highly non-gaussian distributions of image features
and causal relations between pairs of edges. We discuss the implications of
this description of natural scenes for the study of vision.

collaborations between the biological, computational, physical and chemical
areas, have implied in increasingly more complex approaches to understand and
model the mammals nervous systems. One particularly important related issue
regards the investigation of the relationship between morphology and function
of neuronal cells, which requires the application of effective means for their
classification, for instance by using multivariated, pattern recognition and
clustering methods. The current work aims at such a study while considering a
large number of neuronal cells obtained from the NeuroMorpho database, which is
currently the most comprehensive such a repository. Our approach applies an
unsupervised clustering technique, known as Superparamagnetic Clustering, over
a set of morphological measurements regarding four major neuronal categories.
In particular, we target two important problems: (i) we investigate the
coherence between the obtained clusters and the original categories; and (ii)
we verify for eventual subclusters inside each of these categories. We report a
good agreement between the obtained clusters and the original categories, as
well as the identification of a relatively complex structure of subclusters in
the case of the pyramidal neuronal cells.

complex neural networks, such as the mammalian cerebral cortex, is the
existence of stable regimes of network activation, typically arising from a
limited parameter range. In this range of limited sustained activity (LSA), the
activity of neural populations in the network persists between the extremes of
either quickly dying out or activating the whole network. Hierarchical modular
networks were previously found to show a wider parameter range for LSA than
random or small-world networks not possessing hierarchical organization or
multiple modules. Here we explored how variation in the number of hierarchical
levels and modules per level influenced network dynamics and occurrence of LSA.
We tested hierarchical configurations of different network sizes, approximating
the large-scale networks linking cortical columns in one hemisphere of the rat,
cat, or macaque monkey brain. Scaling of the network size affected the number
of hierarchical levels and modules in the optimal networks, also depending on
whether global edge density or the numbers of connections per node were kept
constant. For constant edge density, only few network configurations,
possessing an intermediate number of levels and a large number of modules, led
to a large range of LSA independent of brain size. For a constant number of
node connections, there was a trend for optimal configurations in larger-size
networks to possess a larger number of hierarchical levels or more modules.
These results may help to explain the trend to greater network complexity
apparent in larger brains and may indicate that this complexity is required for
maintaining stable levels of neural activation.

organization of natural systems. The present article extends this important
principle to the systematic identification and analysis of singular motifs in
complex networks. Six measurements quantifying different and complementary
features of the connectivity around each node of a network were calculated, and
multivariate statistical methods applied to identify singular nodes. The
potential of the presented concepts and methodology was illustrated with
respect to different types of complex real-world networks, namely the US air
transportation network, the protein-protein interactions of the yeast
Saccharomyces cerevisiae and the Roget thesaurus networks. The obtained
singular motifs possessed unique functional roles in the networks. Three
classic theoretical network models were also investigated, with the
Barab\'asi-Albert model resulting in singular motifs corresponding to hubs,
confirming the potential of the approach. Interestingly, the number of
different types of singular node motifs as well as the number of their
instances were found to be considerably higher in the real-world networks than
in any of the benchmark networks.

distribution over activation barrier energies for enzymatic/protein reactions
is revealed. We consider an enzyme solution as an ensemble of individual
molecules with different values of the activation barrier energy described by
the distribution. From the solvent viscosity effect on the preexponent we
derive the integral equation for the distribution and find its approximate
solution. Our approach enables us to attain a twofold purpose. On the one hand
it yields a simple interpretation of the solvent viscosity dependence for
enzymatic/protein reactions that requires neither a modification of the
Kramers' theory nor that of the Stokes law. On the other hand our approach
enables us to deduce the form of the distribution over activation barrier
energies. The obtained function has a familiar bell-shaped form and is in
qualitative agreement with the results of single enzyme kinetics measurements.
General formalism is exemplified by the analysis of literature experimental
data.

behavior of spikes dynamics instead of membrane potential dynamics. The spike
response is not sought as a deterministic response in this context, but as a
conditional probability : "Reading out the code" consists of inferring such a
probability. This probability is computed from empirical raster plots, by using
the framework of thermodynamic formalism in ergodic theory. This gives us a
parametric statistical model where the probability has the form of a Gibbs
distribution. In this respect, this approach generalizes the seminal and
profound work of Schneidman and collaborators. A minimal presentation of the
formalism is reviewed here, while a general algorithmic estimation method is
proposed yielding fast convergent implementations. It is also made explicit how
several spike observables (entropy, rate, synchronizations, correlations) are
given in closed-form from the parametric estimation. This paradigm does not
only allow us to estimate the spike statistics, given a design choice, but also
to compare different models, thus answering comparative questions about the
neural code such as : "are correlations (or time synchrony or a given set of
spike patterns, ..) significant with respect to rate coding only ?" A numerical
validation of the method is proposed and the perspectives regarding spike-train
code analysis are also discussed.

scarce resources are ubiquitous. Yet, without proper mechanisms to ensure
cooperation, the evolutionary pressure to maximize individual success tends to
create a tragedy of the commons (such as over-fishing or the destruction of our
environment). This contribution addresses a number of related puzzles of human
behavior with an evolutionary game theoretical approach as it has been
successfully used to explain the behavior of other biological species many
times, from bacteria to vertebrates. Our agent-based model distinguishes
individuals applying four different behavioral strategies: non-cooperative
individuals ("defectors"), cooperative individuals abstaining from punishment
efforts (called "cooperators" or "second-order free-riders"), cooperators who
punish non-cooperative behavior ("moralists"), and defectors, who punish other
defectors despite being non-cooperative themselves ("immoralists"). By
considering spatial interactions with neighboring individuals, our model
reveals several interesting effects: First, moralists can fully eliminate
cooperators. This spreading of punishing behavior requires a segregation of
behavioral strategies and solves the "second-order free-rider problem". Second,
the system behavior changes its character significantly even after very long
times ("who laughs last laughs best effect"). Third, the presence of a number
of defectors can largely accelerate the victory of moralists over non-punishing
cooperators. Forth, in order to succeed, moralists may profit from immoralists
in a way that appears like an "unholy collaboration". Our findings suggest that
the consideration of punishment strategies allows to understand the
establishment and spreading of "moral behavior" by means of game-theoretical
concepts. This demonstrates that quantitative biological modeling approaches
are powerful even in domains that have been addressed with non-mathematical
concepts so far. The complex dynamics of certain social behaviors becomes
understandable as result of an evolutionary competition between different
behavioral strategies.

network can often be rescued by the targeted removal of enzyme-coding
genes--the exact opposite of what traditional gene therapy would suggest.
Predictions go as far as to assert that certain gene knockouts can restore the
growth of otherwise nonviable gene-deficient cells. Many questions follow from
this discovery: What are the underlying mechanisms? How generalizable is this
effect? What are the potential applications? Here, I will approach these
questions from the perspective of compensatory perturbations on networks.
Relations will be drawn between such synthetic rescues and naturally occurring
cascades of reaction inactivation, as well as their analogues in physical and
other biological networks. I will specially discuss how rescue interactions can
lead to the rational design of antagonistic drug combinations that select
against resistance and how they can illuminate medical research on cancer,
antibiotics, and metabolic diseases.

variety of brain spatiotemporal activity patterns. An important problem in
neuroscience is to understand the mechanism by which the human brain's 100
billion neurons and 100 trillion synapses manage to produce this large
repertoire of cortical configurations in a flexible manner. In addition, it is
recognized that temporal correlations across such configurations cannot be
arbitrary, but they need to meet two conflicting demands: while diverse
cortical areas should remain functionally segregated from each other, they must
still perform as a collective, i.e., they are functionally integrated. Here, we
investigate these large-scale dynamical properties by inspecting the character
of the spatiotemporal correlations of brain resting-state activity. In physical
systems, these correlations in space and time are captured by measuring the
correlation coefficient between a signal recorded at two different points in
space at two different times. We show that this two-point correlation function
extracted from resting-state fMRI data exhibits self-similarity in space and
time. In space, self-similarity is revealed by considering three successive
spatial coarse-graining steps while in time it is revealed by the 1/f frequency
behavior of the power spectrum. The uncovered dynamical self-similarity implies
that the brain is spontaneously at a continuously changing (in space and time)
intermediate state between two extremes, one of excessive cortical integration
and the other of complete segregation. This dynamical property may be seen as
an important marker of brain well-being both in health and disease.

environment recording sensory information about the state space X of the
environment in real time. Sensory information is sampled and then processed on
two levels. On the biological level, the organism serves as an evaluation
mechanism of the subjective relevance of the incoming data to the observer: the
observer assigns excitation values to events in X it could recognize using its
sensory equipment. On the algorithmic level, sensory input is used for updating
a database, the memory of the observer whose purpose is to serve as a
geometric/combinatorial model of X, whose nodes are weighted by the excitation
values produced by the evaluation mechanism. These values serve as a guidance
system for deciding how the database should transform as observation data
mounts. We define a searching problem for the proposed model and discuss the
model's flexibility and its computational efficiency, as well as the
possibility of implementing it as a dynamic network of neuron-like units. We
show how various easily observable properties of the human memory and thought
process can be explained within the framework of this model. These include:
reasoning (with efficiency bounds), errors, temporary and permanent loss of
information. We are also able to define general learning problems in terms of
the new model, such as the language acquisition problem.

rebound burst durations is observed and referred to as a response stochastic
incoherence. A general mechanism underlying this phenomenon is given, being
different from those reported so far in excitable systems. It is shown to be
determined by (i) the monotonic reduction of the hysteresis responsible for
bursting caused by noise and consequent transformation of responses from
rebound bursts to single spikes, and (ii) a symmetry breaking in distributions
of burst durations caused by the existence of the minimum response length. The
phenomenon is studied numerically in a Morris-Lecar model for neurons and its
mechanism is explained with the use of canonical models describing hard
excitation states.

a species with colonies located on each site of $\mathbb {Z}^d$. In each of the
four models studied, an individual in a local population can reproduce, die or
migrate to neighboring sites. We prove that an increase of the death rate when
the local population density is small (the Allee effect) may be critical for
survival, and that the migration of large flocks of individuals is a possible
solution to avoid extinction when the Allee effect is strong. We use
attractiveness and comparison with oriented percolation, either to prove the
extinction of the species, or to construct nontrivial invariant measures for
each model.

been developed. Recently, $O(N^6)$ time and $O(N^4)$ space dynamic programming
algorithms have become available that compute the partition function of RNA-RNA
interaction complexes. However, few of these methods incorporate the knowledge
concerning related sequences, thus relevant evolutionary information is often
neglected from the structure determination. Therefore, it is of considerable
practical interest to introduce a method taking into consideration both
thermodynamic stability and sequence covariation. We present the \emph{a
priori} folding algorithm \texttt{ripalign}, whose input consists of two
(given) multiple sequence alignments (MSA). \texttt{ripalign} outputs (1) the
partition function, (2) base-pairing probabilities, (3) hybrid probabilities
and (4) a set of Boltzmann-sampled suboptimal structures consisting of
canonical joint structures that are compatible to the alignments. Compared to
the single sequence-pair folding algorithm \texttt{rip}, \texttt{ripalign}
requires negligible additional memory resource. Furthermore, we incorporate
possible structure constraints as input parameters into our algorithm. The
algorithm described here is implemented in C as part of the \texttt{rip}
package. The supplemental material, source code and input/output files can

morphological structure of hosts such as plant roots, crop fields, farms,
cells, animal habitats and social networks, when the transmission of infection
occurs between contiguous hosts. Morphological complexity brings an inherent
heterogeneity in populations and affects the dynamics of pathogen spread in
such systems. We have analysed the influence of realistically complex host
morphology on the threshold for invasion and epidemic outbreak in an SIR
(susceptible-infected-recovered) epidemiological model. We show that disorder
expressed in the host morphology and anisotropy reduces the probability of
epidemic outbreak and thus makes the system more resistant to epidemic
outbreaks. We obtain general analytical estimates for minimally safe bounds for
an invasion threshold and then illustrate their validity by considering an
example of host data for branching hosts (salamander retinal ganglion cells).
Several spatial arrangements of hosts with different degrees of heterogeneity
have been considered in order to analyse separately the role of shape
complexity and anisotropy in the host population. The estimates for invasion
threshold are linked to morphological characteristics of the hosts that can be
used for determining the threshold for invasion in practical applications.

of polymers either to understand biological processes or to develop new
nano-biomaterials. We investigate the conformations of a semiflexible polymer
ring in weak spherical confinement imposed by an impenetrable shell. We develop
an analytic argument for the dominating polymer trajectory depending on polymer
flexibility considering elastic and entropic contributions. Monte Carlo
simulations are performed to assess polymer ring conformations in probability
densities and by the shape measures asphericity and nature of asphericity.
Comparison of the analytic argument with the mean asphericity and the mean
nature of asphericity confirm our reasoning to explain polymer ring
conformations in the stiff regime, where elastic response prevails.

to identify a small number of genes or drugs potentially relevant to human
biology or disease. In HTS experiments, robots and computers do a significant
portion of the experimental work. However, one remaining major bottleneck is
the manual analysis of experimental results, which is commonly in the form of
microscopy images. This manual inspection is labor intensive, slow and
subjective. Here we report our progress towards applying computer vision and
machine learning methods to analyze HTS experiments that use Caenorhabditis
elegans (C. elegans) worms grown on agar. Our main contribution is a robust
segmentation algorithm for separating the worms from the background using
brightfield images. We also show that by combining the output of this
segmentation algorithm with an algorithm to detect the fluorescent dye, Nile
Red, we can reliably distinguish different fluorescence-based phenotypes even
though the visual differences are subtle. The accuracy of our method is similar
to that of expert human analysts. This new capability is a significant step
towards fully automated HTS experiments using C. elegans.

in inhibitory networks and becomes more intense when an excitatory population
is included. We find a strikingly high rate of entropy production that would
limit information representation in cortical spike patterns to the immediate

polypeptide chains to aggregate by exhaustively sampling the sequence and
conformational space. The morphologies of the fibril-like structures and the
time scales ($\tau_{fib}$) for their formation depend on a subtle balance
between hydrophobic and coulomb interactions. The extent of population of a
fibril-prone structure in the spectrum of monomer conformations is the major
determinant of $\tau_{fib}$. This observation is used to determine the
aggregation-prone consensus sequences by exhaustively exploring the sequence
space. Our results provide a basis for genome wide search of fragments that are
aggregation prone.

mathematical population genetics the ancestral history of a population of genes
back in time is described by John Kingman's coalescent tree. Classical and
modern approaches model gene frequencies by diffusion processes. This paper,
which is partly a review, discusses how coalescent processes are dual to
diffusion processes in an analytic and probabilistic sense. Bochner (1954) and
Gasper (1972) were interested in characterizations of processes with Beta
stationary distributions and Jacobi polynomial eigenfunctions. We discuss the
connection with Wright--Fisher diffusions and the characterization of these
processes. Subordinated Wright--Fisher diffusions are of this type. An Inverse
Gaussian subordinator is interesting and important in subordinated
Wright--Fisher diffusions and is related to the Jacobi Poisson Kernel in
orthogonal polynomial theory. A related time-subordinated forest of non-mutant
edges in the Kingman coalescent is novel.

The
equations are partial differential equations in a continuous multiple component
system in which adequate initial and boundary conditions are given. The
biochemical patterns are spatiotemporal distributions of multiple biochemical
components that can be regarded as a continuum in concentration and mass flux.
Recognizing biochemical patterns lead to a universal property of the equations,
which is also mathematically demonstrated, that the devised equations are
sufficient to approximate any orbits in an arbitrary dynamical system, even
though that of expectedly seen in complex biological systems. This theory can
be applied to also a non-biological system that can be regarded as a continuum
comprised of any multiple components such as liquids, solids, and nonlinear
viscoelastic materials.

spectrum: the abundance of organisms as a function of their weight
approximately follows a power law over almost ten orders of magnitude. We
interpret this as evidence that the population dynamics in the ocean is
approximately scale-invariant. We use this invariance in the construction and
solution of a size-structured dynamical population model. Starting from a
Markov model encoding the basic processes of predation, reproduction,
maintenance respiration and intrinsic mortality, we derive a partial
integro-differential equation describing the dependence of abundance on weight
and time. Our model represents an extension of the jump-growth model and hence
also of earlier models based on the McKendrick--von Foerster equation. The
model is scale-invariant provided the rate functions of the stochastic
processes have certain scaling properties. We determine the steady-state power
law solution, whose exponent is determined by the relative scaling between the
rates of the density-dependent processes (predation) and the rates of the
density-independent processes (reproduction, maintenance, mortality). We study
the stability of the steady-state against small perturbations and find that
inclusion of maintenance respiration and reproduction in the model has astrong
stabilising effect. Furthermore, the steady state is unstable against a change
in the overall population density unless the reproduction rate exceeds a
certain threshold.

folded, but always filling the whole bud volume. This {\guillemotleft} filling
law {\guillemotright} has many consequences, in particular on the shape of
growing folded leaves. This is shown here for different types of folding and
packing. The folded volume is always part of an ellipsoid, with the veins on
the outside rounded face, and the lamina margin on an adaxial plane or axis.
The veins on the abaxial side protect the more fragile lamina. The first
general consequence of the folds is the presence of symmetries on the leaf
shape, but also quantitative relationships between lobes and sinus sizes. For
particular geometries, the leaf lamina can be limited by lateral veins,
creating spoon-like lobes, or transverse cuts, creating asymmetrical wavy
perimeters. A change in the packing between cultivars induces the corresponding
change in the leaf shape. Each particular case shows how pervasive are the
geometrical consequences of the filling law.

(2010)</comments><license>http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/</license><abstract>  Energy transfer (relaxation) phenomena are ubiquitous in nature. At a
macroscopic level, the phenomenological theory of heat (Fourier law)
successfully describes heat transfer and energy flow. However, its microscopic
origin is still under debate. This is because the phenomena can contain
many-body, multi-scale, nonequilibrium, and even quantum mechanical aspects,
which present significant challenges to theories addressing energy transfer
phenomena in physics, chemistry and biology. In this paper, we describe our
recent theoretical attempts to treat vibrational energy relaxation (VER) in
biomolecular systems, including peptide, porphyrin, and protein. First we
construct a reduced model using (instantaneous) normal mode analysis, and
further add anharmonic coupling between vibrational modes. Using such a model
combined with time-dependent perturbation theory for the anharmonic coupling,
we derive non-Markovian VER formulas, which are applicable to small timescales
such as sub picoseconds. We apply the VER formulas with full atomistic detail
to various biomolecular systems, discuss the VER timescales and mechanisms, and
compare with experiment if possible. We finally mention further theoretical
prospects of the energy transfer phenomena in physics, chemistry, and biology.

determination of diversity and function prediction of microbial community
members. Here we detail our bioinformatics methods for analyzing population
distribution and diversity in large microbial communities. This was achieved
via (i) a homology based method for robust phylotype determination, equaling
the classification accuracy of the Ribosomal Database Project (RDP) classifier,
but providing improved associations of closely related sequences; (ii) a
comparison of different clustering methods for achieving more accurate richness
estimations. Our methodology, which we developed using the RDP vetted 16S rRNA
gene sequence set, was validated by testing it on a large 16S rRNA gene dataset
of approximately 2300 sequences, which we obtained from a soil microbial
community study. We concluded that the best approach to obtain accurate
phylogenetics profile of large microbial communities, based on 16S rRNA gene
sequence information, is to apply an optimized blast classifier. This approach
is complemented by the grouping of closely related sequences, using complete
linkage clustering, in order to calculate richness and evenness indices for the
communities.

$N$-steps polygons in the cubic lattice with fixed knot type. By collecting a
rich statistics of configurations with very large values of $N$ we are able to
analyse the asymptotic behaviour of the partition function of the problem for
different knot types. Our results confirm that, in the large $N$ limit, each
prime knot is localized in a small region of the polygon, regardless of the
possible presence of other knots. Each prime knot component may slide along the
unknotted region contributing to the overall configurational entropy with a
term proportional to $\ln N$. Furthermore, we discover that the mere existence
of a knot requires a well defined entropic cost that scales exponentially with
its minimal length. In the case of polygons with composite knots it turns out
that the partition function can be simply factorized in terms that depend only
on prime components with an additional combinatorial factor that takes into
account the statistical property that by interchanging two identical prime knot
components in the polygon the corresponding set of overall configuration
remains unaltered. Finally, the above results allow to conjecture a sequence of
inequalities for the connective constants of polygons whose topology varies
within a given family of composite knot types.

gene is regulated by few of the genes in the network. They also tend to have
broad distributions for the out-degree. What mechanisms might be responsible
for these degree distributions? Starting with an accepted framework of the
binding of transcription factors to DNA, we consider a simple model of gene
regulatory dynamics. There, we show that selection for a target expression
pattern leads to the emergence of minimum connectivities compatible with the
selective constraint. As a consequence, these gene networks have low in-degree,
and "functionality" is parsimonious, i.e. is concentrated on a sparse number of
interactions as measured for instance by their essentiality. Furthermore, we
find that mutations of the transcription factors drive the networks to have
broad out-degrees. Finally, these classes of models are evolvable, i.e.
significantly different genotypes can emerge gradually under mutation-selection
balance.

investigated. Overwinding, where strain leads to further winding, is shown to
be a universal property for helices, which are stretched along their
longitudinal axis when the initial pitch angle is below the zero-twist angle
(39.4 deg). Unwinding occurs at larger pitch angles. The zero-twist angle is
the unique pitch angle at the point between overwinding and unwinding, and it
is independent of the mechanical properties of the double helix. This suggests
the existence of zero-twist structures, i.e. structures that display neither
overwinding, nor unwinding under strain. Estimates of the overwinding of DNA,
chromatin, and RNA are given.

self-organized criticality in the complex calcium waves and patterns. Both the
stochastic cellular automaton approach and the equation-based simulations can
predict the characteristics of calcium waves and complex pattern formation. The
implication of locality of calcium distribution with positional information in
biological systems is also discussed.

asexual populations evolving on complex fitness landscapes may achieve a higher
fitness than large ones due to the increased heterogeneity of adaptive
trajectories. Here we introduce a class of haploid three-locus fitness
landscapes that allows to investigate this scenario in a precise and
quantitative way.
  Results: Our main result derived analytically shows how the probability of
choosing the path of largest initial fitness increase grows with the population
size. This makes large populations more likely to get trapped at local fitness
peaks and implies an advantage of small populations at intermediate time
scales. The range of population sizes where this effect is operative coincides
with the onset of clonal interference. Additional studies using ensembles of
random fitness landscapes show that the results achieved for a particular
choice of three-locus landscape parameters are robust and also persist as the
number of loci increases.
  Conclusions: Our study indicates that an advantage for small populations is
likely whenever the fitness landscape contains local maxima. The advantage
appears at intermediate time scales, which are long enough for trapping at
local fitness maxima to have occurred but too short for peak escape by the
creation of multiple mutants.

rotary flagellar motor powered by an ion current from the mitochondria. Direct
observation of the step-like motion of these machines with time series from
novel experimental assays has recently become possible. These time series are
corrupted by molecular and experimental noise that requires removal, but
classical signal processing is of limited use for recovering such step-like
dynamics. This paper reports simple, novel Bayesian filters that are robust to
step-like dynamics in noise, and introduce an L1-regularized, global filter
whose sparse solution can be rapidly obtained by standard convex optimization
methods. We show these techniques outperforming classical filters on simulated
time series in terms of their ability to accurately recover the underlying step
dynamics. To show the techniques in action, we extract step-like speed
transitions from Rhodobacter sphaeroides flagellar motor time series. Code

amplification by an active process in the mechanoreceptive hair cells. In most
vertebrates the active process stems from the active motility of hair bundles.
The mammalian cochlea exhibits an additional form of mechanical activity termed
electromotility: its outer hair cells (OHCs) change length upon electrical
stimulation. The relative contributions of these two mechanisms to the active
process in the mammalian inner ear is the subject of intense current debate.
Here we show that active hair-bundle motility and electromotility can together
implement an efficient mechanism for amplification that functions like a
ratchet: sound-evoked forces acting on the basilar membrane are transmitted to
the hair bundles whereas electromotility decouples active hair-bundle forces
from the basilar membrane. This unidirectional coupling can extend the hearing
range well below the resonant frequency of the basilar membrane. It thereby
provides a concept for low-frequency hearing that accounts for a variety of
unexplained experimental observations from the cochlear apex, including the
shape and phase behavior of apical tuning curves, their lack of significant
nonlinearities, and the shape changes of threshold tuning curves of auditory
nerve fibers along the cochlea. The ratchet mechanism constitutes a general
design principle for implementing mechanical amplification in engineering
applications.

response to gradients of signaling molecules. During fly development in early
Drosophila embryos, the Bicoid (Bcd) morphogen gradient is established within
the first hour after fertilization. Bcd acts as a transcription factor,
initiating the expression of a cascade of genes that determine the segmentation
pattern of the embryo, which serves as a blueprint for the future adult
organism. A robust understanding of the mechanisms that govern this
segmentation cascade is still lacking, and a new generation of quantitative
measurements of the spatio-temporal concentration dynamics of the individual
players of this cascade are necessary for further progress. Here we describe a
series of methods that are meant to represent a start of such a quantification
using Bcd as an example. We describe the generation of a transgenic fly line
expressing a Bcd-eGFP fusion protein, and we use this line to carefully analyze
the Bcd concentration dynamics and to measure absolute Bcd expression levels in
living fly embryos using two-photon microscopy. These experiments have proven
to be a fruitful tool generating new insights into the mechanisms that lead to
the establishment and the readout of the Bcd gradient. Generalization of these
methods to other genes in the Drosophila segmentation cascade is
straightforward and should further our understanding of the early patterning
processes and the architecture of the underlying genetic network structure.

that the probabilities per unit time of disease transmission and recovery from
disease are constant, implying exponential distributions of the time intervals
for transmission and recovery. Time intervals for real diseases, however, have
distributions that in most cases are far from exponential, which leads to
disagreements, both qualitative and quantitative, with the models. In this
paper, we study a generalized version of the SIR
(susceptible-infected-recovered) model of epidemic disease that allows for
arbitrary distributions of transmission and recovery times. Standard
differential equation approaches cannot be used for this generalized model, but
we show that the problem can be reformulated as a time-dependent message
passing calculation on the appropriate contact network. The calculation is
exact on trees (i.e., loopless networks) or locally tree-like networks (such as
random graphs) in the large system size limit. On non-tree-like networks we
show that the calculation gives a rigorous bound on the size of disease
outbreaks. We demonstrate the method with applications to two specific models
and the results compare favorably with numerical simulations.

which the neurons interact via pulse-like signals. We found that the type of

of the system to the external modulation. We develop a mean-field theory based
on an order parameter expansion that quantitatively reproduces the numerical
results in the case of diffusive coupling.

We study
the dynamics of evolving, asexually reproducing populations in which a certain
number of mutations jointly confer a fitness advantage. We consider the time
until a population has evolved from one fitness peak to another one with a
higher fitness. The order of mutations can either be fixed or random. If the
order of mutations is fixed, then the population follows a metaphorical ridge,
a single path. If the order of mutations is arbitrary, then there are many ways
to evolve to the higher fitness state. We address the time required for
fixation in such scenarios and study how it is affected by the order of
mutations, the population size, the fitness values and the mutation rate.

studied in great detail. These games have been used to model many biologically
relevant scenarios, ranging from social dilemmas in mammals to microbial
diversity. Some of these games may in fact take place between a number of
individuals and not just between two. Here, we address one-shot games with
multiple players. As long as we have only two strategies, many results from two
player games can be generalized to multiple players. For games with multiple
players and more than two strategies, we show that statements derived for
pairwise interactions do no longer hold. For two player games with any number
of strategies there can be at most one isolated internal equilibrium. For any
number of players $\boldsymbol{d}$ with any number of strategies n, there can
be at most (d-1)^(n-1) isolated internal equilibria. Multiplayer games show a
great dynamical complexity that cannot be captured based on pairwise
interactions. Our results hold for any game and can easily be applied for
specific cases, e.g. public goods games or multiplayer stag hunts.

  placement of sequences onto a fixed reference tree</title><categories>q-bio.PE q-bio.GN</categories><license>http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/</license><abstract>  Likelihood-based phylogenetic inference is generally considered to be the
most reliable classification method for unknown sequences. However, traditional
likelihood-based phylogenetic methods cannot be applied to large volumes of
short reads from next-generation sequencing due to computational complexity
issues and lack of phylogenetic signal. "Phylogenetic placement," where a
reference tree is fixed and the unknown query sequences are placed onto the
tree via a reference alignment, is a way to bring the inferential power of
likelihood-based approaches to large data sets. This paper introduces pplacer,
a software package for phylogenetic placement and subsequent visualization. The
algorithm can place twenty thousand short reads on a reference tree of one
thousand taxa per hour per processor, has essentially linear time and memory
complexity in the number of reference taxa, and is easy to run in parallel.
Pplacer features calculation of the posterior probability of a placement on an
edge, which is a statistically rigorous way of quantifying uncertainty on an
edge-by-edge basis. It also can inform the user of the positional uncertainty
for query sequences by calculating expected distance between placement
locations, which is crucial in the estimation of uncertainty with a
well-sampled reference tree. The software provides visualizations using branch
thickness and color to represent number of placements and their uncertainty. A
simulation study using reads generated from 631 COG alignments shows a high
level of accuracy for phylogenetic placement over a wide range of alignment
diversity, and the power of edge uncertainty estimates to measure placement
confidence. Pplacer enables efficient phylogenetic placement and subsequent
visualization, making likelihood-based phylogenetics methodology practical for
large collections of reads; it is available as source code, binaries, and a web
service.

compositions and well-separated Raman peaks have been synthesized and
conjugated to five targeting ligands in order to impart molecular specificity.
Multiplexed Raman imaging of live cells has been carried out by highly specific
staining of cells with a five-color mixture of SWNTs. Ex vivo multiplexed Raman
imaging of tumor samples uncovers a surprising up-regulation of epidermal
growth factor receptor (EGFR) on LS174T colon cancer cells from cell culture to
in vivo tumor growth. This is the first time five-color multiplexed molecular
imaging has been performed in the near-infrared (NIR) region under a single
laser excitation. Near zero interfering background of imaging is achieved due
to the sharp Raman peaks unique to nanotubes over the low, smooth
autofluorescence background of biological species.

natural environments. In this paper, we focus on microorganisms which use
flagella for propulsion. We address how swimming velocities are affected in
nonlinearly viscoelastic fluids by examining the problem of an infinitely long
cylinder with arbitrary beating motion in the Oldroyd-B fluid. We solve for the
swimming velocity in the limit in which deflections of the cylinder from its
straight configuration are small relative to the radius of the cylinder and the
wavelength of the deflections; furthermore, the radius of the cylinder is small
compared to the wavelength of deflections. We find that swimming velocities are
diminished by nonlinear viscoelastic effects. We apply these results to examine
what types of swimming motions can produce net translation in a nonlinear
fluid, comparing to the Newtonian case, for which Purcell's "scallop" theorem
describes how time-reversibility constrains which swimming motions are
effective. We find that the leading order violation of the scallop theorem
occurs for reciprocal motions in which the backward and forward strokes occur
at different rates.

cells when a division occurs. The cell division rate may depend on the quantity
of parasites inside the cell and we are interested in the cases of constant or
monotone division rate. We first determine the asymptotic behavior of the
quantity of parasites in a cell line, which follows a Feller diffusion with
multiplicative jumps. We then consider the evolution of the infection of the
cell population and give criteria to determine whether the proportion of
infected cells goes to zero (recovery) or if a positive proportion of cells
becomes largely infected (proliferation of parasites inside the cells).

inhomogeneities in the FitzHugh-Nagumo model to investigate possible mechanisms
for the occurrence of fibrillatory states in the atria of the heart. Different
dynamical patterns such as ectopic foci, localized and meandering spiral waves
are found depending on the characteristics of the inhomogeneities. Their
appearance in dependence of the size and strength of the inhomogeneities is
quantified by phase diagrams. Furthermore it is shown that regularly paced
waves in a region R, that is connected by a small bridge connection to another
region L with perturbing waves emanating from an additional pacemaker, can be
strongly disturbed, so that a fibrillatory state emerges in region R after a
transient time interval. This finding supports conjectures that fibrillatory
states in the right atrium can be induced by self-excitatory pacemakers in the
left atrium.

theory of protein folding, has also been used in modeling the RNA folding and
some epitaxial phenomena. The advantage of this model is that it admits exact
solution in the general inhomogeneous case (Bruscolini and Pelizzola, 2002)
which facilitates the study of realistic systems. However, a shortcoming of the
model is that it accounts only for interactions within continuous stretches of
native bonds or atomic chains while neglecting interstretch (interchain)
interactions. But due to the biopolymer (atomic chain) flexibility, the
monomers (atoms) separated by several non-native bonds along the sequence can
become closely spaced. This produces their strong interaction. The inclusion of
non-WSME interactions into the model makes the model more realistic and
improves its performance. In this study we add arbitrary interactions of finite
range and solve the new model by means of the transfer matrix technique. We can
therefore exactly account for the interactions which in proteomics are
classified as medium- and moderately long-range ones.

sequence of conductance pulses arriving through the synapse in the high
frequency regime. In addition to the usual excitation threshold there is a
smooth crossover from the firing to the silent regime for increasing pulse
amplitude $g_{syn}$. The amplitude of the voltage spikes decreases
approximately linearly with $g_{syn}$. In some regions of parameter space the
response is irregular, probably chaotic. In the chaotic regime between the
mode-locked regions 3:1 and 2:1 near the lower excitation threshold the output
interspike interval histogram (ISIH) undergoes a sharp transition. If the
driving period is below the critical value, $T_i &lt; T^*$, the output histogram
contains only odd multiples of $T_i$. For $T_i &gt; T^*$ even multiples of $T_i$
also appear in the histogram, starting from the largest values. Near $T^*$ the
ISIH scales logarithmically on both sides of the transition. The coefficient of
variation of ISIH has a cusp singularity at $T^*$. The average response period
has a maximum slightly above $T^*$. Near the excitation threshold in the
chaotic regime the average firing rate rises sublinearly from frequencies of
order 1 Hz.

body axis of Drosophila by binding to transcriptional enhancers across the
genome. Each such enhancer activates a neighboring gene at a unique threshold
concentration of Dorsal. The presence of Dorsal binding site clusters in these
enhancers and of similar clusters in other enhancers has motivated models of
threshold-encoding in site density. However, we found that the precise length
of a spacer separating a pair of specialized Dorsal and Twist binding sites
determines the threshold-response. Despite this result, the functional range
determined by this spacer element as well as the role and origin of its
surrounding Dorsal site cluster remained completely unknown. Here, we
experiment with enhancers from diverse Drosophila genomes, including the large
uncompacted genomes from ananassae and willistoni, and report three major
interdependent results. First, we map the functional range of the
threshold-encoding spacer variable. Second, we show that the majority of sites
at the cluster are non-functional divergent elements that have been separated
beyond the encoding's functional range. Third, we verify an evolutionary model
involving the frequent replacement of a threshold encoding, whose precision is
easily outdated by shifting accuracy. The process by which encodings are
replaced by newer ones is facilitated by the palindromic nature of the Dorsal
and Twist binding motifs and by intrinsic repeat-instability in the specialized
Twist binding site, which critically impacts the length of the spacer linking
it to Dorsal. Over time, the dynamic process of selective deprecation and
replacement of encodings adds to a growing cluster of deadened elements, or
necro-elements, and strongly biases local sequence composition. ... [ABSTRACT

accuracy of estimating phylogenetic parameters for a fixed number of species as
we increase the number of characters. However, as sequences are often of fixed
length (e.g. for a gene) although we are often able to sample more taxa, it is
useful to consider a dual type of statistical consistency where we increase the
number of species, rather than characters. This raises some basic questions:
what can we learn about the evolutionary process as we increase the number of
species? In particular, does having more species allow us to infer the
ancestral state of characters accurately? This question is particularly
relevant when sequence site evolution varies in a complex way from character to
character, as well as for reconstructing ancestral sequences. In this paper, we
assemble a collection of results to analyse various approaches for inferring
ancestral information with increasing accuracy as the number of taxa increases.

improvements in the rapid, precision extraction of discrete state dynamics from
large databases of experimental observations of molecular machines. By building
physical knowledge and statistical innovations into analysis tools, we
demonstrate new techniques for recovering discrete state transitions buried in
highly correlated molecular noise. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our
approach on simulated and real examples of step-like rotation of the bacterial
flagellar motor and the F1-ATPase enzyme. We show that our method can clearly
identify molecular steps, symmetries and cascaded processes that are too weak
for existing algorithms to detect, and can do so much faster than existing
algorithms. Our techniques represent a major advance in the drive towards
automated, precision, highthroughput studies of molecular machine dynamics.

  cluster validation</title><categories>q-bio.QM q-bio.GN</categories><comments>9 pages, 9 figures</comments><license>http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/</license><abstract>  Fuzzy c-means clustering is widely used to identify cluster structures in
high-dimensional data sets, such as those obtained in DNA microarray and
quantitative proteomics experiments. One of its main limitations is the lack of
a computationally fast method to determine the two parameters fuzzifier and
cluster number. Wrong parameter values may either lead to the inclusion of
purely random fluctuations in the results or ignore potentially important data.
The optimal solution has parameter values for which the clustering does not
yield any results for a purely random data set but which detects cluster
formation with maximum resolution on the edge of randomness. Estimation of the
optimal parameter values is achieved by evaluation of the results of the
clustering procedure applied to randomized data sets. In this case, the optimal
value of the fuzzifier follows common rules that depend only on the main
properties of the data set. Taking the dimension of the set and the number of
objects as input values instead of evaluating the entire data set allows us to
propose a functional relationship determining its value directly. This result
speaks strongly against setting the fuzzifier equal to 2 as typically done in
many previous studies. Validation indices are generally used for the estimation
of the optimal number of clusters. A comparison shows that the minimum distance
between the centroids provides results that are at least equivalent or better
than those obtained by other computationally more expensive indices.

genomic features, ranked by their relevance in modelling biological phenotype
in terms of a classification or regression model. Due to resampling protocols
or just within a meta-analysis comparison, instead of one list it is often the
case that sets of alternative feature lists (possibly of different lengths) are
obtained. Here we introduce a method, based on the algebraic theory of
symmetric groups, for studying the variability between lists ("list stability")
in the case of lists of unequal length. We provide algorithms evaluating
stability for lists embedded in the full feature set or just limited to the
features occurring in the partial lists. The method is demonstrated first on
synthetic data in a gene filtering task and then for finding gene profiles on a
recent prostate cancer dataset.

motion of the Dam1 ring complex is now thought to play an important role in the
generation of forces during mitosis. Our current understanding of this motion
is based on a number of detailed computational models. Although these models
realize possible mechanisms for force transduction, they can be extended by
variation of any of a large number of poorly measured parameters and there is
no clear strategy for determining how they might be distinguished
experimentally. Here we seek to identify and analyze two distinct mechanisms
present in the computational models. In the first the splayed protofilaments at
the end of the depolymerizing MT physically prevent the Dam1 ring from falling
off the end, in the other an attractive binding secures the ring to the
microtubule. Based on this analysis, we discuss how to distinguish between
competing models that seek to explain how the Dam1 ring stays on the MT. We
propose novel experimental approaches that could resolve these models for the
first time, either by changing the diffusion constant of the Dam1 ring (e.g.,
by tethering a long polymer to it) or by using a time varying load.

  diseases</title><categories>q-bio.PE</categories><comments>21 pages</comments><license>http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/</license><abstract>  Network epidemiology often assumes that the relationships defining the social
network of a population are static. The dynamics of relationships is only taken
indirectly into account, by assuming that the relevant information to study
epidemic spread is encoded in the network obtained by considering numbers of
partners accumulated over periods of time roughly proportional to the
infectious period of the disease at hand. On the other hand, models explicitly
including social dynamics are often too schematic to provide a reasonable
representation of a real population, or so detailed that no general conclusions
can be drawn from them. Here we present a model of social dynamics that is
general enough that its parameters can be obtained by fitting data from surveys
about sexual behaviour, but that can still be studied analytically, using mean
field techniques. This allows us to obtain some general results about epidemic
spreading. We show that using accumulated network data to estimate the static
epidemic threshold leads to a significant underestimation of it. We also show
that, for a dynamic network, the relative epidemic threshold is an increasing
function of the infectious period of the disease, implying that the static
value is a lower bound to the real threshold.

disease spread between different populations connected by a network. In
particular, these models are at the basis of most simulations of pandemic
spread. They are usually studied at the mean-field level by neglecting
fluctuations. Here we include fluctuations in the models by adopting fully
stochastic descriptions of the corresponding processes. This level of
description allows to address analytically, in the SIS and SIR cases, problems
such as the existence and the calculation of an effective threshold for the
spread of a disease at a global level. We show that the possibility of the
spread at the global level is described in terms of (bond) percolation on the
network. This mapping enables us to give an estimate (lower bound) for the
pandemic threshold in the SIR case for all values of the model parameters and
for all possible networks.

becomes internal) if its distance from the root (depth) is i. For c&gt;1, we
reanalyse the tree profile, i.e. the numbers of external vertices in depth
i=1,2,.... Our main result are concrete formulas for the expectation and
covariance-structure of the profile. In addition, we present the application of
the model to cellular ageing. Here, we assume that nodes in depth h+1 are
senescent, i.e. do not split. We obtain a limit result for the proportion of
non-senescent vertices for large h.

calculated the salt bridge energies, total residue electrostatic potential
energies, and transfer energies into a low dielectric amyloid-like phase for 12
species and mutants of the prion protein. Salt bridges and self energies play
key roles in stabilizing secondary and tertiary structural elements of the
prion protein. The total electrostatic potential energy of each residue was
found to be invariably stabilizing. Residues frequently found to be mutated in
familial prion disease were among those with the largest electrostatic
energies. The large barrier to charged group desolvation imposes regional
constraints on involvement of the prion protein in an amyloid aggregate,
resulting in an electrostatic amyloid recruitment pro?le that favours regions
of sequence between alpha helix 1 and beta strand 2, the middles of helices 2
and 3, and the region N-terminal to alpha helix 1. We found that the
stabilization due to salt bridges is minimal among the proteins studied for
disease-susceptible human mutants of prion protein.

can catalyze via enzymes encoded in its genome. A genotype is viable in a given
environment if it is capable of producing all biomass components the organism
needs to survive and reproduce. Previous work has focused on the properties of
individual genotypes while little is known about how genome-scale metabolic
networks with a given function can vary in their reaction content. Results: We
here characterize spaces of such genotypes. Specifically, we study metabolic
genotypes whose phenotype is viability in minimal chemical environments that
differ in their sole carbon sources. We show that regardless of the number of
reactions in a metabolic genotype, the genotypes of a given phenotype typically
form vast, connected, and unstructured sets -- genotype networks -- that nearly
span the whole of genotype space. The robustness of metabolic phenotypes to
random reaction removal in such spaces has a narrow distribution with a high
mean. Different carbon sources differ in the number of metabolic genotypes in
their genotype network; this number decreases as a genotype is required to be
viable on increasing numbers of carbon sources, but much less than if metabolic
reactions were used independently across different chemical environments.
Conclusions: Our work shows that phenotype-preserving genotype networks have
generic organizational properties and that these properties are insensitive to
the number of reactions in metabolic genotypes.

volume fraction is solved and hence the condition for a helix to be
close-packed is obtained. The close-packed triple helix is shown to have a
pitch angle of $v_{CP} =43.3 ^\circ$. Contrary to the conventional notion, we
suggest that close packing form the underlying principle behind the structure
of collagen, and the implications of this suggestion are considered. Further,
it is shown that the unique zero-twist structure with no strain-twist coupling
is practically identical to the close-packed triple helix. Some of the
difficulties for the current understanding of the structure of collagen are
reviewed: The ambiguity in assigning crystal structures for collagen-like
peptides, and the failure to satisfactorily calculate circular dichroism
spectra. Further, the proposed new geometrical structure for collagen is better
packed than both the 10/3 and the 7/2 structure. A feature of the suggested
collagen structure is the existence of a central channel with negatively
charged walls. We find support for this structural feature in some of the early
x-ray diffraction data of collagen. The central channel of the structure
suggests the possibility of a one-dimensional proton lattice. This geometry can
explain the observed magic angle effect seen in NMR studies of collagen. The
central channel also offers the possibility of ion transport and may cast new
light on various biological and physical phenomena, including
biomineralization.

approaches to information in biology. As a consequence, functional responses
based on an appropriate interpretation of signals has been replaced by a
probabilistic description of correlations between emitted and received symbols.
This assumption leads to potential paradoxes, such as the presence of a maximum
information associated to a channel that would actually create completely wrong
interpretations of the signals. Game-theoretic models of language evolution use
this view of Shannon's theory, but other approaches considering embodied
communicating agents show that the correct (meaningful) match resulting from
agent-agent exchanges is always achieved and natural systems obviously solve
the problem correctly. How can Shannon's theory be expanded in such a way that
meaning -at least, in its minimal referential form- is properly incorporated?
Inspired by the concept of {\em duality of the communicative sign} stated by
the swiss linguist Ferdinand de Saussure, here we present a complete
description of the minimal system necessary to measure the amount of
information that is consistently decoded. Several consequences of our
developments are investigated, such the uselessness of an amount of information
properly transmitted for communication among autonomous agents.

presynaptic bouton to study local calcium dynamics leading to vesicle fusion. A
kinetic model with two calcium sensors is formulated specifically for the
CA3-CA1 synapse. The model includes a sensor for fast synchronous release that
lasts a few tens of milliseconds and a sensor for slow asynchronous release
that lasts a few hundred milliseconds. We show that a variety of extant data on
CA3-CA1 synapse can be accounted for consistently only when a refractory period
of the order of few milliseconds between releases is introduced. Including a
second sensor for asynchronous release that has a slow unbinding site and
therefore an embedded long memory, is shown to play a role in short-term
plasticity by facilitating release. For synchronous release mediated by
Synaptotagmin II a third time scale is revealed in addition to the fast and
slow release. This third time scale corresponds to "stimulus-correlated
super-fast" neurotransmitter release. Our detailed spatial simulation indicates
that all three-time scales of neurotransmitter release are an emergent property
of the calcium sensor and independent of synaptic ultrastructure. Furthermore,
it allows us to identify features of synaptic transmission that are universal
and those that are modulated by structure.

individuals has been the object of intense study by evolutionary biologists,
mainly because cooperation often flourishes in biological systems in apparent
contradiction to the selfish goal of survival inherent in Darwinian evolution.
In order to resolve this paradox, evolutionary game theory has focused on the
Prisoner's Dilemma (PD), which incorporates the essence of this conflict. Here,
we encode strategies for the iterated Prisoner's Dilemma (IPD) in terms of
conditional probabilities that represent the response of decision pathways
given previous plays. We find that if these stochastic strategies are encoded
as genes that undergo Darwinian evolution, the environmental conditions that
the strategies are adapting to determine the fixed point of the evolutionary
trajectory, which could be either cooperation or defection. A transition
between cooperative and defective attractors occurs as a function of different
parameters such a mutation rate, replacement rate, and memory, all of which
affect a player's ability to predict an opponent's behavior.

collective benefits of group membership can only be harvested if the fraction
of cooperators within the group, i.e. their critical mass, exceeds a threshold
value. Considering structured populations, we show that a moderate fraction of
cooperators can prevail even at very low multiplication factors if the critical
mass is minimal. For larger multiplication factors, however, the level of
cooperation is highest at an intermediate value of the critical mass. The
latter is robust to variations of the group size and the interaction network
topology. Applying the optimal critical mass threshold, we show that the
fraction of cooperators in public goods games is significantly larger than in
the traditional linear model, where the produced public good is proportional to
the fraction of cooperators within the group.

though the purpose and mechanistic origin of such activity remains poorly
understood. We explore the ignition and spread of collective spontaneous
electrophysiological burst activity in networks of cultured cortical neurons
growing on microelectrode arrays using information theory and
first-spike-in-burst analysis methods. We show the presence of burst leader
neurons, which form a mono-synaptically connected primary circuit, and initiate
a majority of network bursts. Leader/follower firing delay times form
temporally stable positively skewed distributions. Blocking inhibitory synapses
usually results in shorter delay times with reduced variance. These
distributions are generalized characterizations of internal network dynamics
and provide estimates of pair-wise synaptic distances. We show that mutual
information between neural nodes is a function of distance, which is maintained
under disinhibition. The resulting analysis produces specific quantitative
constraints and insights into the activation patterns of collective neuronal
activity in self-organized cortical networks, which may prove useful for models
emulating spontaneously active systems.

given alignments are significantly incongruent. Our method compares the two
distributions of phylogenetic trees given by the input alignments, instead of
comparing point estimations of trees. This statistical approach can be applied
to gene tree analysis for example, detecting unusual events in genome evolution
such as horizontal gene transfer and reshuffling. Our method uses difference of
means to compare two distributions of trees, after embedding trees in a vector
space. Bootstrapping alignment columns can then be applied to obtain p-values.
To compute distances between means, we employ a "kernel trick" which speeds up
distance calculations when trees are embedded in a high-dimensional feature
space, e.g. splits or quartets feature space. In this pilot study, first we
test our statistical method's ability to distinguish between sets of gene trees
generated under coalescence models with species trees of varying dissimilarity.
We follow our simulation results with applications to various data sets of
gophers and lice, grasses and their endophytes, and different fungal genes from
the same genome. A companion toolkit, {\tt Phylotree}, is provided to
facilitate computational experiments.

fluctuations in the collective dynamics of bistable units in the presence of a
rapidly varying external signal, and intermediate noise levels. The
archetypical signature of this phenomenon is that --beyond the increase in the
level of fluctuations-- the response of the system becomes uncorrelated with
the external driving force, making it different from stochastic resonance.
Numerical simulations and an analytical theory of a stochastic dynamical
version of the Ising model on regular and random networks demonstrate the
ubiquity and robustness of this phenomenon, which is argued to be a possible
cause of excess volatility in financial markets, of enhanced effective
temperatures in a variety of out-of-equilibrium systems and of strong selective
responses of immune systems of complex biological organisms. Extensive
numerical simulations are compared with a mean-field theory for different
network topologies.

been used in biology to describe the steady state behaviour of population
models which, while eventually certain to become extinct, nevertheless maintain
an apparent stochastic equilibrium for long periods. These distributions have
some drawbacks: they need not exist, nor be unique, and their calculation can
present problems. In this paper, we give biologically plausible conditions
under which the quasi-stationary distribution is unique, and can be closely
approximated by distributions that are simple to compute.

of sexual species. The reason for this biological property to be available to
the observers of nature seems to be a question never asked. Introducing the
notion of historically adapted populations as global minimizers of maintenance
cost functions, we propose a theoretical explanation for the reported stability
of this feature. This mathematical formulation suggests that sex ratio could be
considered as an indirect result shaped by the antagonism between the size of
the population and the finiteness of resources.

entry of new species. Such 'biotic resistance' recently has been questioned
because of successful entry of alien species into diverse natural communities.
Data on 10,409 naturalizations of 5350 plant species over 16 sites dispersed
globally show exponential distributions for both species over sites and sites
over number of species shared. These exponentials signal a statistical
mechanics of species distribution, assuming two conditions. First, species and
sites are equivalent, either identical ('neutral'), or so complex that the
chance a species is in the right place at the right time is vanishingly small
('idiosyncratic'); the range of species and sites in our data disallows a
neutral explanation. Secondly, the total number of naturalisations is fixed in
any era by a 'regulator'. Previous correlation of species naturalization rates
with net primary productivity over time suggests that regulator is related to
productivity. We conclude that biotic resistance is a moving ceiling, with
resistance controlled by productivity. The general observation that the
majority of species occur naturally at only a few sites but only a few at many
now has a quantitative [exponential] character, offering the study of species'
distributions a previously unavailable rigor.

variables, the most widely utilized, interaction information, suffers from the
problem that it is sometimes negative. Here we reconsider from first principles
the general structure of the information that a set of sources provides about a
given variable. We begin with a new definition of redundancy as the minimum
information that any source provides about each possible outcome of the
variable, averaged over all possible outcomes. We then show how this measure of
redundancy induces a lattice over sets of sources that clarifies the general
structure of multivariate information. Finally, we use this redundancy lattice
to propose a definition of partial information atoms that exhaustively
decompose the Shannon information in a multivariate system in terms of the
redundancy between synergies of subsets of the sources. Unlike interaction
information, the atoms of our partial information decomposition are never
negative and always support a clear interpretation as informational quantities.
Our analysis also demonstrates how the negativity of interaction information
can be explained by its confounding of redundancy and synergy.

population bursts of 2D living neural networks. A leader neuron is, basically,
a neuron which fires at the beginning of a burst (respectively network spike)
more often that we expect by looking at its whole mean neural activity. This
means that leader neurons have some burst triggering power beyond a simple
statistical effect. In this study, we characterize these leader neuron
properties. This naturally leads us to simulate neural 2D networks. To build
our simulations, we choose the leaky integrate and fire (lIF) neuron model. Our
lIF model has got stable leader neurons in the burst population that we
simulate. These leader neurons are excitatory neurons and have a low membrane
potential firing threshold. Except for these two first properties, the
conditions required for a neuron to be a leader neuron are difficult to
identify and seem to depend on several parameters involved in the simulations
themself. However, a detailed linear analysis shows a trend of the properties
required for a neuron to be a leader neuron. Our main finding is: A leader
neuron sends a signal to many excitatory neurons as well as to a few inhibitory
neurons and a leader neuron receives only a few signals from other excitatory
neurons. Our linear analysis exhibits five essential properties for leader
neurons with relative importance. This means that considering a given neural
network with a fixed mean number of connections per neuron, our analysis gives
us a way of predicting which neuron can be a good leader neuron and which
cannot. Our prediction formula gives us a good statistical prediction even if,
considering a single given neuron, the success rate does not reach hundred
percent.

phosphorylation cycle and a transcription-translation cycle to generate
circadian rhythms that are highly robust against biochemical noise. We use
stochastic simulations to analyze how these cycles interact to generate stable
rhythms in growing, dividing cells. We find that a protein phosphorylation
cycle by itself is robust when protein turnover is low. For high decay or
dilution rates (and co mpensating synthesis rate), however, the
phosphorylation-based oscillator loses its integrity. Circadian rhythms thus
cannot be generated with a phosphorylation cycle alone when the growth rate,
and consequently the rate of protein dilution, is high enough; in practice, a
purely post-translational clock ceases to function well when the cell doubling
time drops below the 24 hour clock period. At higher growth rates, a
transcription-translation cycle becomes essential for generating robust
circadian rhythms. Interestingly, while a transcription-translation cycle is
necessary to sustain a phosphorylation cycle at high growth rates, a
phosphorylation cycle can dramatically enhance the robustness of a
transcription-translation cycle at lower protein decay or dilution rates. Our
analysis thus predicts that both cycles are required to generate robust
circadian rhythms over the full range of growth conditions.

  Computational Biology</comments><license>http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/</license><abstract>  Various molecular interaction networks have been claimed to follow power-law
decay for their global connectivity distribution. It has been proposed that
there may be underlying generative models that explain this heavy-tailed
behavior by self-reinforcement processes such as classical or hierarchical
scale-free network models. Here we analyze a comprehensive data set of
protein-protein and transcriptional regulatory interaction networks in yeast,
an E. coli metabolic network, and gene activity profiles for different
metabolic states in both organisms. We show that in all cases the networks have
a heavy-tailed distribution, but most of them present significant differences
from a power-law model according to a stringent statistical test. Those few
data sets that have a statistically significant fit with a power-law model
follow other distributions equally well. Thus, while our analysis supports that
both global connectivity interaction networks and activity distributions are
heavy-tailed, they are not generally described by any specific distribution
model, leaving space for further inferences on generative models.

population, in which molecular alterations can be somatically inherited by
genetic, epigenetic or extragenetic transmission processes, leading to a
cooperation of neoplastic cells within tumoral tissue. The efflux protein
P-glycoprotein (P gp) is overexpressed in many cancer cells and has known
capacity to confer multidrug resistance to cytotoxic therapies. Recently,
cell-to-cell P-gp transfers have been shown. Herein, we combine experimental
evidence and a mathematical model to examine the consequences of an
intercellular P-gp trafficking in the extragenetic transfer of multidrug
resistance from resistant to sensitive cell subpopulations. We report
cell-to-cell transfers of functional P-gp in co-cultures of a P-gp
overexpressing human breast cancer MCF-7 cell variant, selected for its
resistance towards doxorubicin, with the parental sensitive cell line. We found
that P-gp as well as efflux activity distribution are progressively reorganized
over time in co-cultures analyzed by flow cytometry. A mathematical model based
on a Boltzmann type integro-partial differential equation structured by a
continuum variable corresponding to P-gp activity describes the cell
populations in co-culture. The mathematical model elucidates the population
elements in the experimental data, specifically, the initial proportions, the
proliferative growth rates, and the transfer rates of P-gp in the sensitive and
resistant subpopulations. We confirmed cell-to-cell transfer of functional
P-gp. The transfer process depends on the gradient of P-gp expression in the
donor-recipient cell interactions, as they evolve over time. Extragenetically
acquired drug resistance is an additional aptitude of neoplastic cells which
has implications in the diagnostic value of P-gp expression and in the design
of chemotherapy regimens

inferring the boundaries and numbers of species has occupied biologists for
centuries, and the debate itself has become known as the species problem. The
modern theory of evolution depends on a fundamental redefinition of "species".
Here we show that based on the model of evolutionary continuum combined with
fuzzy theory that the evolution system is a uncountable infinite set and
species is a fuzzy set, the contradiction between discrete biological entities
and continuous evolution system is solved, i.e. when a species evolved, the
individuals scattered in space but continuously distributed on time sequences.
Moreover, the calculation methods for species are suggested both in theory and
practice.

time-series, but their use requires estimating unobserved states. The optimal
estimate of the state is its conditional expectation given the observation
histories, and computing this expectation is hard when there are
nonlinearities. Existing filtering methods, including sequential Monte Carlo,
tend to be either inaccurate or slow. In this paper, we study a nonlinear
filter for nonlinear/non-Gaussian state-space models, which uses Laplace's
method, an asymptotic series expansion, to approximate the state's conditional
mean and variance, together with a Gaussian conditional distribution. This {\em
Laplace-Gaussian filter} (LGF) gives fast, recursive, deterministic state
estimates, with an error which is set by the stochastic characteristics of the
model and is, we show, stable over time. We illustrate the estimation ability
of the LGF by applying it to the problem of neural decoding and compare it to
sequential Monte Carlo both in simulations and with real data. We find that the
LGF can deliver superior results in a small fraction of the computing time.

redundancy or informational correlation (IC) and another is from k-mer
frequency statistics. Two problems are investigated. The first is how the ICs
exceed the fluctuation bound and the order emerges from fluctuation in a genome
when the sequence length attains some critical value. We demonstrated that the
transition from fluctuation to order takes place at about sequence length
200-300 thousands bases for human and E coli genome. It means that the life
emerges from a region between macroscopic and microscopic. The second is about
the statistical law of the k-mer organization in a genome under the
evolutionary pressure and functional selection. We deduced a sum rule Q(k,N) on
the k-mer frequency deviations from the randomness in a N-long sequence of
genome and deduced the relations of Q(k,N) with k and N. We found that Q(k,N)
increases with length N at a constant rate for most genome sequences and
demonstrated that when the functional selection of k-mers is accumulated to
some critical value the ordering takes place. An important finding is the sum
rule correlated with the evolutionary complexity of the genome.

exchangeable coalescent (also known as Xi-coalescent) started from a large
finite configuration, and undergoing neutral mutations. Asymptotic expressions
for the number of active lineages were obtained by the author in a previous
work. Analogous results for the number of active mutation-free lineages and the
combined lineage lengths are derived using the same martingale-based technique.
They are given in terms of convergence in probability, while extensions to
convergence in moments and convergence almost surely are discussed. The above
mentioned results have direct consequences on the sampling theory in the
Xi-coalescent setting. In particular, the regular Xi-coalescents that come down
from infinity (i.e., with locally finite genealogies), have an asymptotically
equal number of families under the corresponding infinite alleles and infinite
sites models. In special cases, quantitative asymptotic formulae for the number
of families that contain a fixed number of individuals can be given.

highthroughput experiments in silico that can predict, or at least suggest, in
vivo phenomena. In this chapter, we compare various models of immunological
memory. We first validate an experimental immunological simulator, developed by
the authors, by simulating several theories of immunological memory with known
results. We then use the same system to evaluate the predicted effects of a
theory of immunological memory. The resulting model has not been explored
before in artificial immune systems research, and we compare the simulated in
silico output with in vivo measurements. Although the theory appears valid, we
suggest that there are a common set of reasons why immunological memory models
are a useful support tool; not conclusive in themselves.

current species-specific analyses, allometry facilitates understanding of limit
cycles amongst different species. So far, body-size regressions have been
derived for the oscillation period of the population densities of warm-blooded
species, in particular herbivores. Here, we extend the allometric analysis to
other clades, allowing for a comparison between the obtained slopes and
intercepts. The oscillation periods were derived from databases and original
studies to cover a broad range of conditions and species. Then, values were
related to specific body size by regression analysis. For different groups of
herbivorous species, the oscillation period increased as a function of
individual mass as a power law with exponents of 0.11-0.27. The intercepts of
the resulting linear regressions indicated that cycle times for equally-sized
species increased from homeotherms up to invertebrates. Overall, cycle times
for predators did not scale to body size. Implications for these differences
were addressed in the light of intra- and interspecific delays.

a plasma activated sintering within an originally developed TiN coated graphite
mold. The surface of porous titanium sheet with or without a coated graphite
mold was characterized. The cell adhesion property of porous titanium sheet was
also evaluated in this study. The peak of TiC was detected on the titanium
sheet processed with the graphite mold without a TiN coating. Since the
titanium fiber elements were directly in contact with the carbon graphite mold
during processing, surface contamination was unavoidable event in this
condition. The TiC peak was not detectable on the titanium sheet processed
within the TiN coated carbon graphite mold. This modified plasma activated
sintering with the TiN coated graphite mold would be useful to fabricate a
contamination free titanium sheet. The number of adherent cells on the modified
titanium sheet was greater than that of the bare titanium plate. Stress fiber
formation and the extension of the cells were observed on the titanium sheets.
This modified titanium sheet is expected to be a new tissue engineering
material in orthopedic bone repair.

approach. Group test is a method of detecting a few positive items from among a
large number of items, and has wide range of applications. In DNA library
screening, positive item corresponds to the clone having a specified DNA
segment, and it is necessary to identify and isolate the positive clones for
compiling the libraries. In the group test, a group of items, called pool, is
assayed in a lump in order to save the cost of testing, and positive items are
detected based on the observation from each pool. It is known that the design
of grouping, that is, pooling design is important to %reduce the estimation
bias and achieve accurate detection. In the probabilistic approach, positive
clones are picked up based on the posterior probability. Naive methods of
computing the posterior, however, involves exponentially many sums, and thus we
need a device. Loopy belief propagation (loopy BP) algorithm is one of popular
methods to obtain approximate posterior probability efficiently. There are some
works investigating the relation between the accuracy of the loopy BP and the
pooling design. Based on these works, we develop pooling design with small
estimation bias of posterior probability, and we show that the balanced
incomplete block design (BIBD) has nice property for our purpose. Some
numerical experiments show that the bias correction under the BIBD is useful to
improve the estimation accuracy.

transplantation on titanium implant has been dawn attention. The surface
scaffold properties of titanium surface play an important role in bone
regenerative potential of cells. The surface topography and chemistry are
postulated to be two major factors increasing the scaffold properties of
titanium implants. This study aimed to evaluate the osteogenic gene expression
of mesenchymal stem cells on titanium processed by wire-type electric discharge
machining. Some amount of roughness and distinctive irregular features were
observed on titanium processed by wire-type electric discharge machining. The
thickness of suboxide layer was concomitantly grown during the processing.
Since the thickness of oxide film and micro-topography allowed an improvement
of mRNA expression of cells, titanium processed by wire-type electric discharge
machining is a promising candidate for mesenchymal stem cell based functional
restoration of implants.

features of biological time. The key point is that usual physical (linear)
representation of time is insufficient, in our view, for the understanding key
phenomena of life, such as rhythms, both physical (circadian, seasonal ...) and
properly biological (heart beating, respiration, metabolic ...). In particular,
the role of biological rhythms do not seem to have any counterpart in
mathematical formalization of physical clocks, which are based on frequencies
along the usual (possibly thermodynamical, thus oriented) time. We then suggest
a functional representation of biological time by a 2-dimensional manifold as a
mathematical frame for accommodating autonomous biological rhythms. The
"visual" representation of rhythms so obtained, in particular heart beatings,
will provide, by a few examples, hints towards possible applications of our
approach to the understanding of interspecific differences or intraspecific
pathologies. The 3-dimensional embedding space, needed for purely mathematical
reasons, allows to introduce a suitable extra-dimension for "representation
time", with a cognitive significance.

phenotypic evolution, extending the well known result that predicts the mean
evolutionary path in adaptive dynamics or quantitative genetics. We show how
this expression gives rise to the notion of fluctuation domains - parts of the
fitness landscape where the rate of evolution is very predictable (due to
fluctuation dissipation) and parts where it is highly variable (due to
fluctuation enhancement). These fluctuation domains are determined by the
curvature of the fitness landscape. Regions of the fitness landscape with
positive curvature, such as adaptive valleys or branching points, experience
enhancement. Regions with negative curvature, such as adaptive peaks,
experience dissipation. We explore these dynamics in the ecological scenarios
of implicit and explicit competition for a limiting resource.

living in random environments whose growth is given by a regime-switching
diffusion. Harvesting acts as a (stochastic) control on the size of the
population. The objective is to find a harvesting strategy which maximizes the
expected total discounted income from harvesting {\em up to the time of
extinction} of the species; the income rate is allowed to be state- and
environment-dependent. This is a singular stochastic control problem with both
the extinction time and the optimal harvesting policy depending on the initial
condition. One aspect of receiving payments up to the random time of extinction
is that small changes in the initial population size may significantly alter
the extinction time when using the same harvesting policy. Consequently, one no
longer obtains continuity of the value function using standard arguments for
either regular or singular control problems having a fixed time horizon. This
paper introduces a new sufficient condition under which the continuity of the
value function for the regime-switching model is established. Further, it is
shown that the value function is a viscosity solution of a coupled system of
quasi-variational inequalities. The paper also establishes a verification
theorem and, based on this theorem, an $\varepsilon$-optimal harvesting
strategy is constructed under certain conditions on the model. Two examples are
analyzed in detail.

or a birth and death process, we often want to find a continuous stochastic
approximation so that the techniques of stochastic differential equations may
be brought to bear. One powerful and useful way to do this is the system size
expansion of van Kampen to express a trajectory as a small stochastic
perturbation to a deterministic trajectory, using a small parameter related to
the volume of the system in question. This is usually pursued only up to first
order, called the Linear Noise Approximation. The usual derivation of this
proceeds via the master equation of the discrete process and derives a
Fokker-Planck equation for the stochastic perturbation, both of which are
equations for the evolution of probability distributions. Here we present a
derivation using stochastic difference equations for the discrete process and
leading, via the chemical Langevin equation of Gillespie, directly to a
stochastic differential equation for the stochastic perturbation. The new
derivation, which does not yield the full system size expansion, draws more
explicitly on the intuition of ordinary differential equations so may be more
easily digestible for some audiences.

  Mechanics, and Physical Analogs</title><categories>q-bio.NC</categories><license>http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/</license><abstract>  The dynamic behavior of scalp potentials (EEG) is apparently due to some
combination of global and local processes with important top-down and bottom-up
interactions across spatial scales. In treating global mechanisms, we stress
the importance of myelinated axon propagation delays and periodic boundary
conditions in the cortical-white matter system, which is topologically close to
a spherical shell. By contrast, the proposed local mechanisms are multiscale
interactions between cortical columns via short-ranged non-myelinated fibers. A
mechanical model consisting of a stretched string with attached nonlinear
springs demonstrates the general idea. The string produces standing waves
analogous to large-scale coherence EEG observed in some brain states. The
attached springs are analogous to the smaller (mesoscopic) scale columnar
dynamics. Generally, we expect string displacement and EEG at all scales to
result from both global and local phenomena. A statistical mechanics of
neocortical interactions (SMNI) calculates oscillatory behavior consistent with
typical EEG, within columns, between neighboring columns via short-ranged
non-myelinated fibers, across cortical regions via myelinated fibers, and also
derive a string equation consistent with the global EEG model.

Adenosine triphosphate (ATP) to move along a filamentous track called
microtubule. The stochastic movement of KIF1A on the track is characterized by
an alternating sequence of pause and translocation. The sum of the durations of
pause and the following translocation defines the dwell time. Using the NOSC
model (Nishinari et. al. PRL, {\bf 95}, 118101 (2005)) of individual KIF1A, we
systematically derive an analytical expression for the dwell time distribution.
More detailed information is contained in the probability densities of the
"conditional dwell times" $\tau_{\pm\pm}$ in between two consecutive steps each
of which could be forward (+) or backward (-). We calculate the probability
densities $\Xi_{\pm\pm}$ of these four conditional dwell times. However, for
the convenience of comparison with experimental data, we also present the two
distributions $\Xi_{\pm}^{*}$ of the times of dwell before a forward (+) and a
backward (-) step. In principle, our theoretical prediction can be tested by
carrying out single-molecule experiments with adequate spatio-temporal
resolution.

power of biophysical theory. A model is needed that can produce these shapes
with a small set of parameters. This paper presents a simple model of leaf
shape based on a growth algorithm, which governs the growth rate of leaf tissue
in two dimensions and hence the outline of the leaf. The growth of leaf lobes
is governed by the position of leaf veins. This model gives an approximation to
a wide variety of higher plant leaf shapes. The variation of leaf shapes found
in closely related plants is discussed in terms of variability in the growth
algorithms. The model can be extended to more complex leaf types.

path integral techniques applied to a nonlinear model Hamiltonian. The base
pairs relative displacements are interpreted as time dependent paths whose
amplitudes are consistent with the model potential for the hydrogen bonds
between complementary strands. The portion of configuration space contributing
to the partition function is determined, at any temperature, by selecting the
ensemble of paths which fulfill the second law of thermodynamics. For a short
DNA fragment, the denaturation is signaled by a succession of peaks in the
specific heat plots while the entropy grows continuously versus $T$. Thus, the
opening of the double strand with bubble formation appears as a smooth
crossover due to base pair fluctuation effects which are accounted for by the
path integral method. The multistep transition is driven by the AT-rich regions
of the DNA fragment. The base pairs path ensemble shows an enhanced degree of
cooperativity at about the same temperatures for which the specific heat peaks
occur. These findings establish a link between microscopic and macroscopic
signatures of the transition. The fractions of mean base pair stretchings are
computed by varying the AT base pairs content and taking some threshold values
for the occurrence of the molecule denaturation.

A review on current models from statistical Physics and
  Theoretical Ecology applied to study language dynamics</comments><license>http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/</license><abstract>  As early indicated by Charles Darwin, languages behave and change very much
like living species. They display high diversity, differentiate in space and
time, emerge and disappear. A large body of literature has explored the role of
information exchanges and communicative constraints in groups of agents under
selective scenarios. These models have been very helpful in providing a
rationale on how complex forms of communication emerge under evolutionary
pressures. However, other patterns of large-scale organization can be described
using mathematical methods ignoring communicative traits. These approaches
consider shorter time scales and have been developed by exploiting both
theoretical ecology and statistical physics methods. The models are reviewed
here and include extinction, invasion, origination, spatial organization,
coexistence and diversity as key concepts and are very simple in their defining
rules. Such simplicity is used in order to catch the most fundamental laws of
organization and those universal ingredients responsible for qualitative
traits. The similarities between observed and predicted patterns indicate that
an ecological theory of language is emerging, supporting (on a quantitative
basis) its ecological nature, although key differences are also present. Here
we critically review some recent advances lying and outline their implications
and limitations as well as open problems for future research.

understanding of the kinetics of bond ruptures as well as protein unfolding
mechanism. Single-molecule experiments with theoretical models have allowed one
to gain insight into free energy landscape for chemical bond and/or protein
folding. For mechanically induced bond rupture, the bond-rupture kinetics may
be governed by loading device. However, the role of loading device on the
kinetics of mechanical rupture has been rarely received much attention until
recently. In this work, we have theoretically and/or computationally studied
the effect of loading-device stiffness on the kinetics of mechanical unfolding.
Specifically, we have considered a one-dimensional model for a bond rupture
whose kinetics is depicted by Kramers' theory. It is elucidated that the
kinetics of bond rupture is determined by force constant of loading device. The
Brownian dynamics simulation of a bond rupture is considered in order to
validate our theory. It is illustrated that the mean rupture force is dependent
on the force constant of a loading device, such that increase in the
loading-device stiffness leads to the higher bond rupture force. Moreover, we
have taken into account the computational simulation of mechanical unfolding of
a small protein, i.e. {\beta}-hairpin. Our simulation shows that unfolding
force is highly correlated with the stiffness of a loading device. Our
numerical and theoretical studies highlight the significance of a loading
device on the kinetics of mechanical unfolding of a chemical bond and/or a
folded domain in the single-molecule mechanical experiments.

are functions rather than single numbers or vectors, and (ii) they are
correlated due to phylogenetic relationships. In this paper we give a flexible
statistical model for such data, by combining assumptions from phylogenetics
with Gaussian processes. We describe its use as a nonparametric Bayesian prior
distribution, both for prediction (placing posterior distributions on ancestral
functions) and model selection (comparing rates of evolution across a
phylogeny, or identifying the most likely phylogenies consistent with the
observed data). Our work is integrative, extending the popular phylogenetic
Brownian Motion and Ornstein-Uhlenbeck models to functional data and Bayesian
inference, and extending Gaussian Process regression to phylogenies. We provide
a brief illustration of the application of our method.

potential drug targets to predicting the spread of epidemics and designing
vaccination strategies, and from finding friends to uncovering criminal
activity. Despite the promise of the network approach, the reliability of
network data is a source of great concern in all fields where complex networks
are studied. Here, we present a general mathematical and computational
framework to deal with the problem of data reliability in complex networks. In
particular, we are able to reliably identify both missing and spurious
interactions in noisy network observations. Remarkably, our approach also
enables us to obtain, from those noisy observations, network reconstructions
that yield estimates of the true network properties that are more accurate than
those provided by the observations themselves. Our approach has the potential
to guide experiments, to better characterize network data sets, and to drive
new discoveries.

contemporaneous information about the course of an epidemic at best.
Individuals at the center of a social network are likely to be infected sooner,
on average, than those at the periphery. However, mapping a whole network to
identify central individuals whom to monitor is typically very difficult. We
propose an alternative strategy that does not require ascertainment of global
network structure, namely, monitoring the friends of randomly selected
individuals. Such individuals are known to be more central. To evaluate whether
such a friend group could indeed provide early detection, we studied a flu
outbreak at Harvard College in late 2009. We followed 744 students divided
between a random group and a friend group. Based on clinical diagnoses, the
progression of the epidemic in the friend group occurred 14.7 days (95% C.I.
11.7-17.6) in advance of the randomly chosen group (i.e., the population as a
whole). The friend group also showed a significant lead time (p&lt;0.05) on day 16
of the epidemic, a full 46 days before the peak in daily incidence in the
population as a whole. This sensor method could provide significant additional
time to react to epidemics in small or large populations under surveillance.
Moreover, the method could in principle be generalized to other biological,
psychological, informational, or behavioral contagions that spread in networks.

ended elastic polymer molecules. The molecule is assumed to have fixed
endpoints on a boundary surface. In particular we discuss the concept of the
winding number, a directional measure of the linking of two curves, which can
be shown to be invariant to the set of continuous deformations vanishing at the
polymer's end-point and which forbid it from passing through itself. This
measure is shown to be the appropriate constraint required to evaluate the
geometrical properties of a constrained DNA molecule. Using the net winding
measure we define a model of an open ended constrained DNA molecule which
combines the necessary constraint of self-avoidance with being analytically
tractable. This model builds upon the local models of Bouchiat and Mezard
(2000). In particular, we present a new derivation of the polar writhe
expression, which detects both the local winding of the curve and non local
winding between different sections of the curve. We then show that this
expression correctly tracks the net twisting of a DNA molecule subject to
rotation at the endpoints, unlike other definitions used in the literature.

within protein sequences statistically enhance protein propensity for
nonspecific binding. We use the term 'promiscuity' to describe such nonspecific
binding. Diagonal correlations represent statistically significant repeats of
sequence patterns where amino acids of the same type are clustered together.
The predicted effect is qualitatively robust with respect to the form of the
microscopic interaction potentials and the average amino acid composition. Our
analytical results provide an explanation for the enhanced diagonal
correlations observed in hubs of eukaryotic organismal proteomes [J. Mol. Biol.
409, 439 (2011)]. We suggest experiments that will allow direct testing of the
predicted effect.

by Elliott Sober. It examines the philosophical foundations of the statistical
arguments used to evaluate hypotheses in evolutionary biology, based on simple
examples and likelihood ratios. The difficulty with reading the book from a
statistician's perspective is the reluctance of the author to engage into model
building and even less into parameter estimation. The first chapter nonetheless
constitutes a splendid coverage of the most common statistical approaches to
testing and model comparison, even though the advocation of the Akaike
information criterion against Bayesian alternatives is rather forceful. The
book also covers an examination of the "intelligent design" arguments against
the Darwinian evolution theory, predictably if unnecessarily resorting to
Popperian arguments to correctly argue that the creationist perspective fails
to predict anything. The following chapters cover the more relevant issues of
assessing selection versus drift and of testing for the presence of a common
ancestor. While remaining a philosophy treatise, Evidence and Evolution is
written in a way that is accessible to laymen, if rather unusual from a
statistician viewpoint, and the insight about testing issues gained from
Evidence and Evolution makes it a worthwhile read.

to experimentally/computationally obtained data annotation associated with
terms from controlled vocabularies. This process usually involves obtaining
statistical significance for each vocabulary term and using the most
significant terms to describe a given set of biological entities, often
associated with weights. Many existing enrichment methods require selections of
(arbitrary number of) the most significant entities and/or do not account for
weights of entities. Others either mandate extensive simulations to obtain
statistics or assume normal weight distribution. In addition, most methods have
difficulty assigning correct statistical significance to terms with few
entities. Implementing the well-known Lugananni-Rice formula, we have developed
a novel approach, called SaddleSum, that is free from all the aforementioned
constraints and evaluated it against several existing methods. With entity
weights properly taken into account, SaddleSum is internally consistent and
stable with respect to the choice of number of most significant entities
selected. Making few assumptions on the input data, the proposed method is
universal and can thus be applied to areas beyond analysis of microarrays.
Employing asymptotic approximation, SaddleSum provides a term-size dependent
score distribution function that gives rise to accurate statistical
significance even for terms with few entities. As a consequence, SaddleSum
enables researchers to place confidence in its significance assignments to
small terms that are often biologically most specific.

research topic. It deals with understanding the processes of immunodegradation
that indicate signs of functionality loss possibly leading to death. Even
though it is not possible to prevent immunosenescence, there is great benefit
in comprehending its causes, which may help to reverse some of the damage done
and thus improve life expectancy. One of the main factors influencing the
process of immunosenescence is the number and phenotypical variety of naive T
cells in an individual. This work presents a review of immunosenescence,
proposes system dynamics modelling of the processes involving the maintenance
of the naive T cell repertoire and presents some preliminary results.

game or, equivalently, cyclic three-species predator-prey models with conserved
total particle density, by means of Monte Carlo simulations on one- and
two-dimensional lattices. Specifically, we investigate the influence of spatial
variability of the reaction rates and site occupancy restrictions on the
transient oscillations of the species densities and on spatial correlation
functions in the quasi-stationary coexistence state. For small systems, we also
numerically determine the dependence of typical extinction times on the number
of lattice sites. In stark contrast with two-species stochastic Lotka-Volterra
systems, we find that for our three-species models with cyclic competition
quenched disorder in the reaction rates has very little effect on the dynamics
and the long-time properties of the coexistence state. Similarly, we observe
that site restriction only has a minor influence on the system's dynamical
properties. Our results therefore demonstrate that the features of the spatial
rock-paper-scissors system are remarkably robust with respect to model
variations, and stochastic fluctuations as well as spatial correlations play a
comparatively minor role.

clusters, triplets or characters into a single network that in some
well-defined sense simultaneously represents them all. We review these four
models and investigate how they are related. In general, the model chosen
influences the minimum number of reticulation events required. However, when
one obtains the input data from two binary trees, we show that the minimum
number of reticulations is independent of the model. The number of
reticulations necessary to represent the trees, triplets, clusters (in the
softwired sense) and characters (with unrestricted multiple crossover
recombination) are all equal. Furthermore, we show that these results also hold
when not the number of reticulations but the level of the constructed network
is minimised. We use these unification results to settle several complexity
questions that have been open in the field for some time. We also give explicit
examples to show that already for data obtained from three binary trees the
models begin to diverge.

features of cognitive and biological time. We focus here on the so called
"extended present" as a result of protentional and retentional activities
(memory and anticipation). Memory, as retention, is treated in some physical
theories (relaxation phenomena, which will inspire our approach), while
protention (or anticipation) seems outside the scope of physics. We then
suggest a simple functional representation of biological protention. This
allows us to introduce the abstract notion of "biological inertia".

experiments for varies purposes, mainly for its ability to handle a large
quantity of data and output high quality results. However, experimenters who
use customized multiple arrays still face many problems, such as the cost and
time to manufacture the masks, and the cost for production of the multiple
arrays by costly machines. Although there is some research on the multiple
arrays, there is little concern on the manufacture time and cost, which is
actually important to experimenters. In this paper, we have proposed methods to
reduce the time and cost for the manufacture of the customized multiple arrays.
We have first introduced a heuristic algorithm for the mask decomposition
problem for multiple arrays. Then a streamline method is proposed for the
integration of different steps of manufacture on a higher level. Experiments
show that our methods are very effective in reduction of the time and cost of
manufacture of multiple arrays.

substitutions over various protein families by sacrificing gene-level
resolution. We develop a codon-based model, in which mutational tendencies of
codon, a genetic code, and the strength of selective constraints against amino
acid replacements can be tailored to a given gene. First, selective constraints
averaged over proteins are estimated by maximizing the likelihood of each 1-PAM
matrix of empirical amino acid (JTT, WAG, and LG) and codon (KHG) substitution
matrices. Then, selective constraints specific to given proteins are
approximated as a linear function of those estimated from the empirical
substitution matrices.
  Akaike information criterion (AIC) values indicate that a model allowing
multiple nucleotide changes fits the empirical substitution matrices
significantly better. Also, the ML estimates of transition-transversion bias
obtained from these empirical matrices are not so large as previously
estimated. The selective constraints are characteristic of proteins rather than
species. However, their relative strengths among amino acid pairs can be
approximated not to depend very much on protein families but amino acid pairs,
because the present model, in which selective constraints are approximated to
be a linear function of those estimated from the JTT/WAG/LG/KHG matrices, can
provide a good fit to other empirical substitution matrices including cpREV for
chloroplast proteins and mtREV for vertebrate mitochondrial proteins.
  The present codon-based model with the ML estimates of selective constraints
and with adjustable mutation rates of nucleotide would be useful as a simple
substitution model in ML and Bayesian inferences of molecular phylogenetic
trees, and enables us to obtain biologically meaningful information at both
nucleotide and amino acid levels from codon and protein sequences.

established as a method to describe complex ligand binding equilibriums
measured in vitro with purified DNA and protein components. Recently, a new
field of applications has opened up for this approach since it has become
possible to experimentally quantify genome-wide protein occupancies in relation
to the DNA sequence. In particular, the organization of the eukaryotic genome
by histone proteins into a nucleoprotein complex termed chromatin has been
recognized as a key parameter that controls the access of transcription factors
to the DNA sequence. New approaches have to be developed to derive statistical
mechanical lattice descriptions of chromatin-associated protein-DNA
interactions. Here, we present the theoretical framework for lattice models of
histone-DNA interactions in chromatin and investigate the (competitive) DNA
binding of other chromosomal proteins and transcription factors. The results
have a number of applications for quantitative models for the regulation of
gene expression.

genome sequencing experiments. In an extension of the classic Lander-Waterman
model, we consider the effect of the length distribution of fragments. We also
introduce the notion of the shape of a coverage function, which can be used to
detect abberations in coverage. The probability theory underlying these
problems is essential for constructing models of current high-throughput
sequencing experiments, where both sample preparation protocols and sequencing
technology particulars can affect fragment length distributions.
  Results: We show that regardless of fragment length distribution and under
the mild assumption that fragment start sites are Poisson distributed, the
fragments produced in a sequencing experiment can be viewed as resulting from a
two-dimensional spatial Poisson process. We then study the jump skeleton of the
the coverage function, and show that the induced trees are Galton-Watson trees
whose parameters can be computed.
  Conclusions: Our results extend standard analyses of shotgun sequencing that
focus on coverage statistics at individual sites, and provide a null model for
detecting deviations from random coverage in high-throughput sequence census
based experiments. By focusing on fragments, we are also led to a new approach
for visualizing sequencing data that should be of independent interest.

mathematically tractable model of gene reproduction and replacement that laid
the foundation for contemporary population genetics. The Wright-Fisher model
and its extensions have given biologists powerful tools of statistical
inference that enabled the quantification of genetic drift and selection. Given
the utility of these tools, we often forget that their model - for
mathematical, and not biological reasons - makes assumptions that are violated
in most real-world populations. In this paper, I consider an alternative
framework that merges P. A. P. Moran's continuous-time Markov chain model of
allele frequency with the density dependent models of ecological competition
proposed by Gause, Lotka and Volterra, that, unlike Moran's model allow for a
stochastically varying -- but bounded -- population size. I require that allele
numbers vary according to a density-dependent population process, for which the
limiting law of large numbers is a dissipative, irreducible, competitive
dynamical system. Under the assumption that this limiting system admits a
codimension one submanifold of attractive fixed points -- a condition that
naturally generalises the weak selection regime of classical population
dynamics -- it is shown that for an appropriate rescaling of time, the finite
dimensional distributions of the original process converge to those of a
diffusion process on the submanifold. Weak convergence results are also
obtained for a related process.

commonly used by cell signaling networks to transmit information about the
extracellular environment into intracellular organelles for the regulation of
the activity and sorting of proteins within the cell. For this study we
reconstructed a literature-based mammalian kinase-substrate network from
several online resources. The interactions within this directed graph network
connect kinases to their substrates, through specific phosphosites including
kinase-kinase regulatory interactions. However, the "signs" of links,
activation or inhibition of the substrate upon phosphorylation, within this
network are mostly unknown. Here we show how we can infer the "signs"
indirectly using data from quantitative phosphoproteomics experiments applied
to mammalian cells combined with the literature-based kinase-substrate network.
Our inference method was able to predict the sign for 321 links and 153
phosphosites on 120 kinases, resulting in signed and directed subnetwork of
mammalian kinase-kinase interactions. Such an approach can rapidly advance the
reconstruction of cell signaling pathways and networks regulating mammalian
cells.

how accurately can it be described by a deterministic mathematical model? To
provide tracks to answer this question, a deterministic system of transport and
diffusion partial differential equations, both physiologically and spatially
structured, is introduced as a model to describe the spatially organized
process of cell proliferation during the development of the central nervous
system. As an initial step towards dealing with the three-dimensional case, a
unidimensional version of the model is presented. Numerical analysis and
numerical tests are performed. In this work we also achieve a first
experimental validation of the proposed model, by using cell proliferation data
recorded from histological sections obtained during the development of the
optic tectum in the chick embryo.

decreased sociability in humans. It has been shown that repeated social defeats
in 10 daily agonistic interactions in male mice led to development of the
expressed level of anxiety and to reduction of communication estimated in the
elevated plus-maze and partition tests, respectively. In the social
interactions test, sociable behavior toward unfamiliar partner and exploratory
activity were dramatically decreased in defeated male mice. Avoidance of
approaching partner was significantly increased. Demonstration of self-grooming
behavior was increased in defeated males. Chronic diazepam treatment (0.5
mg/kg, i.p., 2 weeks) led to significant decrease of anxiety level estimated in
the elevated plus maze test and to improvement of communication in the
partition test. In the social interaction test diazepam completely restored the
level of sociability and exploratory activity and reduced avoidance behavior of
approaching partner. Diazepam did not affect self-grooming demonstration. It is
concluded that main factor which provokes decrease in communication in defeated
male mice is the high level of anxiety. Similarity between changes in social
behavior in defeated mice and symptoms of autism in humans is discussed. It is
supposed that this behavioral approach may be useful for studying the molecular
mechanisms of autistic spectrum disorders, developing under chronic negative
social experiences.

characterize nature of obstructed diffusion in model and cellular lipid
membranes. Amongst all the techniques developed for this purpose, FCS, by means
of determination of FCS diffusion laws, has been shown to be a very efficient
approach. In this paper, FCS diffusion laws are used to probe the behavior of a
pure lipid and a lipid mixture at temperatures below and above phase
transitions, both numerically, using a full thermodynamic model, and
experimentally. In both cases FCS diffusion laws exhibit deviation from free
diffusion and reveal the existence of domains. The variation of these domains
mean size with temperature is in perfect correlation with the enthalpy
fluctuation.

the complexity of binding scenarios. Here we describe an extended
conformational selection model which embraces a repertoire of selection and
adjustment processes. Induced fit can be viewed as a subset of this repertoire,
whose contribution is affected by the bond-types stabilizing the interaction
and the differences between the interacting partners. We argue that protein
segments whose dynamics are distinct from the rest of the protein ('discrete
breathers') can govern conformational transitions and allosteric propagation
that accompany binding processes, and as such may be more sensitive to
mutational events. Additionally, we highlight the dynamic complexity of binding
scenarios as they relate to events such as aggregation and signalling, and the
crowded cellular environment.

commonly interpreted as a reflection of synchronized network activity, but its
relationship to observed transient coincident firing of neurons on the
millisecond time-scale remains unclear. Here we present experimental evidence
to reconcile the notions of synchrony at the level of neuronal spiking and at
the mesoscopic scale. We demonstrate that only in time intervals of excess
spike synchrony, coincident spikes are better entrained to the LFP than
predicted by the locking of the individual spikes. This effect is enhanced in
periods of large LFP amplitudes. A quantitative model explains the LFP dynamics
by the orchestrated spiking activity in neuronal groups that contribute the
observed surplus synchrony. From the correlation analysis, we infer that
neurons participate in different constellations but contribute only a fraction
of their spikes to temporally precise spike configurations, suggesting a dual
coding scheme of rate and synchrony. This finding provides direct evidence for
the hypothesized relation that precise spike synchrony constitutes a major
temporally and spatially organized component of the LFP. Revealing that
transient spike synchronization correlates not only with behavior, but with a
mesoscopic brain signal corroborates its relevance in cortical processing.

the partition function of a protein obeying two-stage-like folding kinetics.
Using the statistical mechanics model of solvation of hydrophobic hydrocarbons
we obtain the partition function of infinitely diluted solution of proteins in
water environment. The calculated dependencies of the protein heat capacities
upon temperature are compared with the corresponding results of experimental
measurements for staphylococcal nuclease and metmyoglobin.

diversity are often predicated on a single newly arisen mutation sweeping
rapidly to fixation. However, a population can also adapt to a new situation by
multiple mutations of similar phenotypic effect that arise in parallel. These
mutations can each quickly reach intermediate frequency, preventing any single
one from rapidly sweeping to fixation globally (a "soft" sweep). Here we study
models of parallel mutation in a geographically spread population adapting to a
global selection pressure. The slow geographic spread of a selected allele can
allow other selected alleles to arise and spread elsewhere in the species
range. When these different selected alleles meet, their spread can slow
dramatically, and so form a geographic patchwork which could be mistaken for a
signal of local adaptation. This random spatial tessellation will dissipate
over time due to mixing by migration, leaving a set of partial sweeps within
the global population. We show that the spatial tessellation initially formed
by mutational types is closely connected to Poisson process models of
crystallization, which we extend. We find that the probability of parallel
mutation and the spatial scale on which parallel mutation occurs is captured by
a single characteristic length that reflects the expected distance a spreading
allele travels before it encounters a different spreading allele. This
characteristic length depends on the mutation rate, the dispersal parameter,
the effective local density of individuals, and to a much lesser extent the
strength of selection. We argue that even in widely dispersing species, such
parallel geographic sweeps may be surprisingly common. Thus, we predict, as
more data becomes available, many more examples of intra-species parallel
adaptation will be uncovered.

viruses and biomolecules from single-shot diffraction snapshots obtained before
the particle is destroyed by the intense femtosecond pulse. This program
requires the ability to determine the orientation of the particle giving rise
to each snapshot at signal levels as low as ~10-2 photons/pixel. Two apparently
different approaches have recently demonstrated this capability. Here we show
they represent different implementations of the same fundamental approach, and
identify the primary factors limiting their performance.

continuous-time Markov chains that describe networks of biochemical reactions
and play an important role in the stochastic modeling of biological systems.
Our approach is based on the construction of a stochastic hybrid model in which
certain discrete random variables of the original Markov chain are approximated
by continuous deterministic variables. We compute the solution of the
stochastic hybrid model using a numerical algorithm that discretizes time and
in each step performs a mutual update of the transient probability distribution
of the discrete stochastic variables and the values of the continuous
deterministic variables. We implemented the algorithm and we demonstrate its
usefulness and efficiency on several case studies from systems biology.

variability. This work discovered a feature of frequency structure of heart
rate variability that is associated with mental readiness. In three independent
groups of 64, 39, and 19 volunteers by the factor analysis of heart rate
periodograms, it has been discovered that there are at least two other heart
rate oscillation phenomena apart from the well known low frequency oscillations
and respiratory arrhythmia. They have periods of 3 and 4 heart beats.
Association of amplitude of 3-beats oscillation with level of mental readiness
was shown due to further observation in two independent groups of 12 and 7.
Moreover, possibility of assessment of mental readiness by the mathematical
model based on heart rate periodogram was suggested.

analyses, and rely heavily on SDS electrophoresis. This mode of separation is
almost exclusively used when a single dimension separation is performed, and
generally represents the second dimension of two-dimensional separations.
Electrophoretic separations for proteomics use robust, well-established
protocols. However, many variations in almost all possible parameters have been
described in the literature over the years, and they may bring a decisive
advantage when the limits of the classical protocols are reached. The purpose
of this article is to review the most important of these variations, so that
the readers can be aware of how they can improve or tune protein separations
according to their needs. The chemical variations reviewed in this paper
encompass gel structure, buffer systems and detergents for SDS electrophoresis,
two-dimensional electrophoresis based on isoelectric focusing and
two-dimensional electrophoresis based on cationic zone electrophoresis.

be realized in hardware, i.e. by a discrete physical system. The problem is
that up to now there is no programming language by which physical systems can
constructively be described. Such tool, however, is essential for the compact
description and automatic production of complex systems. This paper introduces
a programming language, called Akton-Algebra, which provides the foundation for
the complete description of discrete physical systems. The approach originates
from the finding that every discrete physical system reduces to a
spatiotemporal topological network of nodes, if the functional and metric
properties are deleted. A next finding is that there exists a homeomorphism
between the topological network and a sequence of symbols representing a
program by which the original nodal network can be reconstructed. Providing
Akton-Algebra with functionality turns it into a flow-controlled general data
processing language, which by introducing clock control and addressing can be
further transformed into a classical programming language. Providing
Akton-Algebra with metrics, i.e. the shape and size of the components, turns it
into a novel hardware system construction language.

bundle formation (Phy. Rev. Lett. 99 (2007) 098101). We also discuss a model
for the microscopic formation of these fibers. Finally, we discuss preliminary

bistable molecule - fluctuating between a curved and a straight configuration
at room temperature - we develop a model for polymorphic dynamics of the
microtubule lattice. We show that tubulin bistability consistently explains
unusual dynamic fluctuations, the apparent length-stiffness relation of grafted
microtubules and the curved-helical appearance of microtubules in general.
Analyzing experimental data we conclude that taxol stabilized microtubules
exist in highly cooperative yet strongly fluctuating helical states. When
clamped by the end the microtubule undergoes an unusual zero energy motion - in
its effect reminiscent of a limited rotational hinge.

propagation on complex networks. They account for the mutual interaction
between the network topology and the states of the nodes. Until now, existing
models have been analyzed using low-complexity analytic formalisms, revealing
nevertheless some novel dynamical features. However, current methods have
failed to reproduce with accuracy the simultaneous time evolution of the
disease and the underlying network topology. In the framework of the adaptive
SIS model of Gross et al. [Phys. Rev. Lett. 96, 208701 (2006)], we introduce an
improved compartmental formalism able to handle this coevolutionary task
successfully. With this approach, we analyze the interplay and outcomes of both
dynamical elements, process and structure, on adaptive networks featuring
different degree distributions at the initial stage.

flourished in recent years, yet more complex systems have mainly been studied
through numerical means. In this paper, a mean-field description is used to
coherently couple the dynamics of the network elements (nodes, vertices,
individuals...) on the one hand and their recurrent topological patterns
(subgraphs, groups...) on the other hand. In a SIS model of epidemic spread on
social networks with community structure, this approach yields a set of ODEs
for the time evolution of the system, as well as analytical solutions for the
epidemic threshold and equilibria. The results obtained are in good agreement
with numerical simulations and reproduce random networks behavior in the
appropriate limits which highlights the influence of topology on the processes.
Finally, it is demonstrated that our model predicts higher epidemic thresholds
for clustered structures than for equivalent random topologies in the case of
networks with zero degree correlation.

the cell's state use bistable biochemical switches as underlying decision
systems. In this work, we aim at linking cellular decisions taking place on a
time scale of years to decades with the biochemical dynamics in signal
transduction and gene regulation, occuring on a time scale of minutes to hours.
We show that a stochastic bistable switch forms a viable biochemical mechanism
to implement decision processes on long time scales. As a case study, the
mechanism is applied to model the initiation of follicle growth in mammalian
ovaries, where the physiological time scale of follicle pool depletion is on
the order of the organism's lifespan. We construct a simple mathematical model
for this process based on experimental evidence for the involved genetic
mechanisms. Despite the underlying stochasticity, the proposed mechanism turns
out to yield reliable behavior in large populations of cells subject to the
considered decision process. Our model explains how the physiological time
constant may emerge from the intrinsic stochasticity of the underlying gene
regulatory network. Apart from ovarian follicles, the proposed mechanism may
also be of relevance for other physiological systems where cells take binary
decisions over a long time scale.

chromosomes in the eukaryotic nucleus and in the bacterial nucleoid. In
particular, highly transcribed genes, RNA polymerases and transcription factors
gather into discrete spatial foci called transcription factories. However, the
mechanisms underlying the formation of these foci and the resulting topological
order of the chromosome remain to be elucidated. Here we consider a
thermodynamic framework based on a worm-like chain model of chromosomes where
sparse designated sites along the DNA are able to interact whenever they are
spatially close-by. This is motivated by recurrent evidence that there exists
physical interactions between genes that operate together. Three important
results come out of this simple framework. First, the resulting formation of
transcription foci can be viewed as a micro-phase separation of the interacting
sites from the rest of the DNA. In this respect, a thermodynamic analysis
suggests transcription factors to be appropriate candidates for mediating the
physical interactions between genes. Next, numerical simulations of the polymer
reveal a rich variety of phases that are associated with different topological
orderings, each providing a way to increase the local concentrations of the
interacting sites. Finally, the numerical results show that both
one-dimensional clustering and periodic location of the binding sites along the
DNA, which have been observed in several organisms, make the spatial
co-localization of multiple families of genes particularly efficient.

  Pairings of a Pattern and a Text</title><categories>q-bio.GN</categories><license>http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/</license><abstract>  Current computational methods for exon-intron structure prediction from a
cluster of transcript (EST, mRNA) data do not exhibit the time and space
efficiency necessary to process large clusters of over than 20,000 ESTs and
genes longer than 1Mb. Guaranteeing both accuracy and efficiency seems to be a
computational goal quite far to be achieved, since accuracy is strictly related
to exploiting the inherent redundancy of information present in a large
cluster. We propose a fast method for the problem that combines two ideas: a
novel algorithm of proved small time complexity for computing spliced
alignments of a transcript against a genome, and an efficient algorithm that
exploits the inherent redundancy of information in a cluster of transcripts to
select, among all possible factorizations of EST sequences, those allowing to
infer splice site junctions that are highly confirmed by the input data. The
EST alignment procedure is based on the construction of maximal embeddings that
are sequences obtained from paths of a graph structure, called Embedding Graph,
whose vertices are the maximal pairings of a genomic sequence T and an EST P.
The procedure runs in time linear in the size of P, T and of the output.
PIntron, the software tool implementing our methodology, is able to process in
a few seconds some critical genes that are not manageable by other gene
structure prediction tools. At the same time, PIntron exhibits high accuracy
(sensitivity and specificity) when compared with ENCODE data. Detailed
experimental data, additional results and PIntron software are available at
http://www.algolab.eu/PIntron.

method, to obtain both the characteristic sizes and the inner composition of
lysozyme-pectin complexes depending on the charge density. Lysozyme is a
globular protein and pectin a natural anionic semiflexible polysaccharide with
a degree of methylation (DM) 0, 43 and 74. For our experimental conditions
(buffer ionic strength I = 2.5 10-2 mol/L and pH between 3 and 7), the
electrostatic charge of lysozyme is always positive (from 8 to 17 depending on
pH). The pectin charge per elementary chain segment is negative and can be
varied from almost zero to one through the change of DM and pH. The weight
molar ratio of lysozyme on pectin monomers is kept constant. The ratio of
negative charge content per volume to positive charge content per volume, -/+,
is varied between 10 and 0.007. On a local scale, for all charged pectins, a
correlation peak appears at 0.2 {\AA}-1 due to proteins clustering inside the
complexes. On a large scale, the complexes appear as formed of spherical
globules with a well defined radius of 10 to 50 nm, containing a few thousands
proteins. The volume fraction Phi of organic matter within the globules derived
from SANS absolute cross-sections is around 0.1. The protein stacking, which
occurs inside the globules, is enhanced when pectin is more charged, due to pH
or DM. The linear charge density of the pectin determines the size of the
globules for pectin chains of comparable molecular weights whether it is
controlled by the pH or the DM. The radius of the globules varies between 10 nm
and 50 nm. In conclusion the structure is driven by electrostatic interactions
and not by hydrophobic interactions. The molecular weight also has a large
influence on the structure of the complexes since long chains tend to form
larger globules. This maybe one reason why DM and pH are not completely
equivalent in our system since DM 0 has a short mass, but this may not be the
only one. For very low pectin charge (-/+ = 0.07), globules do not appear and
the scattering signals a gel-like structure. We did not observe any
beads-on-a-string structure.

involved in protein association with cellular membranes. In this study, we
developed numerical simulations of lateral diffusion and exchange of
fluorophores in membranes with arbitrary bleach geometry and exchange of the
membrane localized fluorophore with the cytosol during Fluorescence Recovery
after Photobleaching (FRAP) experiments. The model simulations were used to
design FRAP experiments with varying bleach region sizes on plasma-membrane
localized wild type GFP-Ras2 with a dual lipid anchor and mutant GFP-Ras2C318S
with a single lipid anchor in live yeast cells to investigate diffusional
mobility and the presence of any exchange processes operating in the time scale
of our experiments. Model parameters estimated using data from FRAP experiments
with a 1 micron x 1 micron bleach region-of-interest (ROI) and a 0.5 micron x
0.5 micron bleach ROI showed that GFP-Ras2, single or dual lipid modified,
diffuses as single species with no evidence of exchange with a cytoplasmic
pool. This is the first report of Ras2 mobility in yeast plasma membrane. The
methods developed in this study are generally applicable for studying diffusion
and exchange of membrane associated fluorophores using FRAP on commercial
confocal laser scanning microscopes.

sequencing DNA or RNA extracted in bulk from a given environment. Comparative
methods are needed that indicate the extent to which two communities differ
given data sets of this type. UniFrac, a method built around a somewhat ad hoc
phylogenetics-based distance between two communities, is one of the most
commonly used tools for these analyses. We provide a foundation for such
methods by establishing that if one equates a metagenomic sample with its
empirical distribution on a reference phylogenetic tree, then the weighted
UniFrac distance between two samples is just the classical
Kantorovich-Rubinstein (KR) distance between the corresponding empirical
distributions. We demonstrate that this KR distance and extensions of it that
arise from incorporating uncertainty in the location of sample points can be
written as a readily computable integral over the tree, we develop $L^p$
Zolotarev-type generalizations of the metric, and we show how the p-value of
the resulting natural permutation test of the null hypothesis "no difference
between the two communities" can be approximated using a functional of a
Gaussian process indexed by the tree. We relate the $L^2$ case to an ANOVA-type
decomposition and find that the distribution of its associated Gaussian
functional is that of a computable linear combination of independent $\chi_1^2$
random variables.

or a quasispecies (QS). A common formalism to approach QS is the
replicator-mutator equation (RME). However, a problem with the RME is how to
quantify the interaction coefficients between viral variants. Here, this is
addressed by adopting an ecological perspective and resorting to the niche
theory of competing communities, which assumes that the utilization of
resources primarily determines ecological segregation between competing
individuals (the different viral variants that constitute the QS). Using this
novel combination of RME plus the ecological concept of niche overlapping, for
describing QS, we explore the population distributions of viral variants that
emerge, as well as the corresponding dynamics. We observe that the population
distribution requires very long transients both to A) reach equilibrium and B)
to show a clear dominating master sequence. Based on different independent and
recent experimental evidence, we find that when some cooperation or
facilitation between variants is included in appropriate doses we can solve
both A) and B). We show that a useful quantity to calibrate the degree of
cooperation is the Shannon entropy. Therefore, in order to get a typical
quasispecies profile, it seems that pure competition is not enough. Rather,
some degree of cooperation among viral variants is needed. This has several
biological implications that might contribute to shed light on the mechanisms
operating in QS dynamics and to understand the QS as a whole entity.

competing strategies: cooperators, defectors, punishing cooperators, and
punishing defectors. To explore the robustness of the cooperation-promoting
effect of costly punishment, besides the usual strategy adoption dynamics we
also apply strategy mutations. As expected, frequent mutations create kind of
well-mixed conditions, which support the spreading of defectors. However, when
the mutation rate is small, the final stationary state does not significantly
differ from the state of the mutation-free model, independently of the values
of the punishment fine and cost. Nevertheless, the mutation rate affects the
relaxation dynamics. Rare mutations can largely accelerate the spreading of
costly punishment. This is due to the fact that the presence of defectors
breaks the balance of power between both cooperative strategies, which leads to
a different kind of dynamics.

biological networks often involves posing the following two questions: Is a
hypothesized structure of a regulatory network consistent with the observed
behavior? And can a proposed structure generate a desired behavior? Answering
these questions presupposes that we are able to test the compatibility of
network structure and behavior. We cast these questions into a parameter search
problem for qualitative models of regulatory networks, in particular
piecewise-affine differential equation models. We develop a method based on
symbolic model checking that avoids enumerating all possible parametrizations,
and show that this method performs well on real biological problems, using the
IRMA synthetic network and benchmark experimental data sets. We test the
consistency between the IRMA network structure and the time-series data, and
search for parameter modifications that would improve the robustness of the
external control of the system behavior.

vastly complicated network N. Since Darwin, species trees have been used as a
simplified description of the relationships which summarize the overly
complicated network N. Recent evidence of hybridization and lateral gene
transfer, however, suggest that there are situations where trees are
inadequate. Consequently it is important to determine properties that
characterize networks closely related to N and possibly more complicated than
trees but lacking the full complexity of N. A connected surjective digraph map
(CSD) is a map f from one network N to another network M which either collapses
an arc to a single point or takes an arc to an arc, which is surjective, and
such that the inverse image of a point is always connected. CSD maps are shown
to behave well under composition. If there is such a CSD map, the network M is
shown to arise naturally as a quotient structure from N. It is proved that if
there is a CSD map from N to M, then there is in a way to lift an undirected
version of M into N, possibly with added resolution. A CSD map from N to M puts
strong constraints on N; if the map were not connected, there would be minimal
constraints. A procedure is defined, given N, to construct a standard
successively cluster-distinct network from N. In general, it may be useful to
study classes of networks such that, for any N, there exists a CSD map from N
to some standard member of that class.

unaided eye. On a non-nutrient substrate the plasmodium propagates as a
traveling localization, as a compact wave-fragment of protoplasm. The
plasmodium-localization travels in its originally predetermined direction for a
substantial period of time even when no gradient of chemo-attractants is
present. We utilize this property of \emph{Physarum} localizations to design a
two-input two-output Boolean logic gates $&lt;x, y&gt; \to &lt;xy, x+y&gt;$ and $&lt;x, y&gt; \to
&lt;x, bar{x}y&gt;$. We verify the designs in laboratory experiments and computer
simulations. We cascade the logical gates into one-bit half-adder and simulate
its functionality.

time-dependent forcing using analytic techniques which allow us to disentangle
the interaction of stochasticity and external forcing. The model is formulated
as a continuous time Markov process, which is decomposed into a deterministic
dynamics together with stochastic corrections, by using an expansion in inverse
system size. The forcing induces a limit cycle in the deterministic dynamics,
and a complete analysis of the fluctuations about this time-dependent solution
is given. This analysis is applied when the limit cycle is annual, and after a
period-doubling when it is biennial. The comprehensive nature of our approach
allows us to give a coherent picture of the dynamics which unifies past work,
but which also provides a systematic method for predicting the periods of
oscillations seen in whooping cough and measles epidemics.

plants, animals, or viral particles, coexist is a question of theoretical and
practical importance in population biology. Both biotic interactions and
environmental fluctuations are key factors that can facilitate or disrupt
coexistence. To better understand this interplay between these deterministic
and stochastic forces, we develop a mathematical theory extending the nonlinear
theory of permanence for deterministic systems to stochastic difference and
differential equations. Our condition for coexistence requires that there is a
fixed set of weights associated with the interacting populations and this
weighted combination of populations' invasion rates is positive for any
(ergodic) stationary distribution associated with a subcollection of
populations. Here, an invasion rate corresponds to an average per-capita growth
rate along a stationary distribution. When this condition holds and there is
sufficient noise in the system, we show that the populations approach a unique
positive stationary distribution. Moreover, we show that our coexistence
criterion is robust to small perturbations of the model functions. Using this
theory, we illustrate that (i) environmental noise enhances or inhibits
coexistence in communities with rock-paper-scissor dynamics depending on
correlations between interspecific demographic rates, (ii) stochastic variation
in mortality rates has no effect on the coexistence criteria for discrete-time
Lotka-Volterra communities, and (iii) random forcing can promote genetic
diversity in the presence of exploitative interactions.

networks as well as investigate hypotheses regarding natural evolution. A
handful of studies have shown how simulated evolution can be used for studying
the functional space spanned by biochemical networks, studying natural
evolution, or designing new synthetic networks. If there was a method for
easily performing such studies, it can allow the community to further
experiment with simulated evolution and explore all of its uses. As a result,
we have developed a library written in the C language that performs all the
basic functions needed to carry out simulated evolution of biological networks.
The library comes with a generic genetic algorithm as well as genetic
algorithms for specifically evolving genetic networks, protein networks, or
mass-action networks. The library also comes with functions for simulating
these networks. A user needs to specify a desired function. A GUI is provided
for users to become oriented with all the options available in the library. The
library is free and open source under the BSD lisence and can be obtained at
evolvenetworks.sourceforge.net. It can be built on all major platforms. The
code can be most conveniently compiled using cross-platform make (CMake).

dynamics of genetic drift, recasting Kimura's selectively neutral theory as a
special case of a generalized drift process using structured populations with
memory. We examine the diffusion and fixation properties of several drift
processes and propose applications to learning, inference, and evolution. We
also demonstrate how the organization of drift process space controls fidelity,
facilitates innovations, and leads to information loss in sequential learning
with and without memory.

repeatedly during the last years and has raised the need for efficient
stochastic tools. We present SABRE, a tool for stochastic analysis of
biochemical reaction networks. SABRE implements fast adaptive uniformization
(FAU), a direct numerical approximation algorithm for computing transient
solutions of biochemical reaction networks. Biochemical reactions networks
represent biological systems studied at a molecular level and these reactions
can be modeled as transitions of a Markov chain. SABRE accepts as input the
formalism of guarded commands, which it interprets either as continuous-time or
as discrete-time Markov chains. Besides operating in a stochastic mode, SABRE
may also perform a deterministic analysis by directly computing a mean-field
approximation of the system under study. We illustrate the different
functionalities of SABRE by means of biological case studies.

are also described. The theoretical results are illustrated on meaningful

whole population, having arisen in a single individual, is known as the
fixation probability. In general, it is not possible to find the fixation
probability analytically given the mutant's fitness and the topological
constraints that govern the spread of the mutation, so one resorts to
simulations instead. Depending on the topology in use, a great number of
evolutionary steps may be needed in each of the simulation events, particularly
in those that end with the population containing mutants only. We introduce two
techniques to accelerate the determination of the fixation probability. The
first one skips all evolutionary steps in which the number of mutants does not
change and thereby reduces the number of steps per simulation event
considerably. This technique is computationally advantageous for some of the
so-called layered networks. The second technique, which is not restricted to
layered networks, consists of aborting any simulation event in which the number
of mutants has grown beyond a certain threshold value, and counting that event
as having led to a total spread of the mutation. For large populations, and
regardless of the network's topology, we demonstrate, both analytically and by
means of simulations, that using a threshold of about 100 mutants leads to an
estimate of the fixation probability that deviates in no significant way from
that obtained from the full-fledged simulations. We have observed speedups of
two orders of magnitude for layered networks with 10000 nodes.

compare the predictions of this mechanism with the previous mechanisms which
were based on the effects of motor proteins. Finally we combine the effects of
microtubules polymerization and motor proteins, and present the detailed phase

(guards) in host cells monitor host target proteins (guardees) that are
manipulated by pathogen effector proteins. A recently suggested extension of
this model includes decoys, which are duplicated copies of guardee proteins,
and which have the sole function to attract the effector and, when modified by
the effector, trigger the plant immune response. Here we present a
proof-of-principle model for the functioning of decoys in plant immunity,
quantitatively developing this experimentally-derived concept. Our model links
the basic cellular chemistry to the outcomes of pathogen infection and
resulting fitness costs for the host. In particular, the model allows
identification of conditions under which it is optimal for decoys to act as
triggers for the plant immune response, and of conditions under which it is
optimal for decoys to act as sinks that bind the pathogen effectors but do not
trigger an immune response.

$2^{i-1}$ daughter cells. At each integral time unit the cells split so that
the stem cell splits into a stem cell and generation 1 daughter cell and the
generation $i$ daughter cells become two cells of generation $i+1$. The last
generation is removed from the population. The stem cell gets first and second
mutations at rates $u_1$ and $u_2$ and the daughter cells get first and second
mutations at rates $v_1$ and $v_2$. We find the distribution for the time it
takes to get two mutations as $N$ goes to infinity and the mutation rates go to
0. We also find the distribution for the location of the mutations. Several
outcomes are possible depending on how fast the rates go to 0. The model
considered has been proposed by Komarova (2007) as a model for colon cancer.

  Prey and M. luteus Decoys</title><categories>q-bio.PE q-bio.QM</categories><license>http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/</license><abstract>  Biofilms are matrix-enclosed microbial communities that grow at interfaces.
They exhibit significant phenotypic changes that render them resistant to many
antibacterial agents that can kill their free-swimming counterparts. Biofilms
in the environment can consist of either a single or multiple microbial
species. Previous investigations in this group demonstrated that Bdellovibrio
bacteriovorus, a gram-negative predatory bacterium that consumes other
gram-negative bacteria, could eradicate a single-species E.coli biofilm in some
conditions1. These results suggest the potential value of B. bacteriovorus in
biofilm eradication in industrial, medical and environmental contexts.
  Here we carried out investigation of the potential of Bdellovibrio
bacteriovorus to interact with and remove multi-species biofilms, specifically
dual-species biofilms of E. coli (gram-negative prey) and M. luteus
(gram-positive decoy) at interfaces between liquid and air. We examined whether
this kind of dual-species biofilms is more, less, or equally susceptible to B.
bacteriovorus attack compared to their single-species counterparts. Different
research methods including bacterial culture, cell counting, crystal violet
staining, gram staining, optical microscopy, scanning electron microscopy, and
atomic force microscopy were exploited to gain an insight into Bdellovibrio's
interaction with biofilms. Our experiments showed that B. bacteriovorus not
only consumes E. coli but also weakens the attachment of M. luteus to the solid
surface, rendering the biofilms susceptible to removal. B. bacteriovorus keeps
in check not only prey but also decoy bacterial populations in the surrounding
media, the latter probably via competition for nutrients. These experiments
encourage us to consider how B. bacteriovorus might be used to control biofilms
in the environment.

the PIN protein are the key regulator for the spatial and temporal organization
of plant development. In particular auxin induces the polar localization of its
own efflux facilitator. Due to this positive feedback auxin flow is directed
and patterns of auxin and PIN arise. During the earliest stage of vein
initiation in leaves auxin accumulates in a single cell in a rim of epidermal
cells from which it flows into the ground meristem tissue of the leaf blade.
There the localized auxin supply yields the successive polarization of PIN
distribution along a strand of cells. We model the auxin and PIN dynamics
within cells with a minimal canalization model. Solving the model analytically
we uncover an excitable polarization front that triggers a polar distribution
of PIN proteins in cells. As polarization fronts may extend to opposing
directions from their initiation site we suggest a possible resolution to the
puzzling occurrence of bipolar cells, such we offer an explanation for the
development of closed, looped veins. Employing non-linear analysis we identify
the role of the contributing microscopic processes during polarization.
Furthermore, we deduce quantitative predictions on polarization fronts
establishing a route to determine the up to now largely unknown kinetic rates
of auxin and PIN dynamics.

dynamics, because they are potential starting points for adaptive
diversification. The antithesis to evolutionary branching points are
Continuously stable strategies (CSS's), which are convergent stable and
evolutionarily stable equilibrium points of the adaptive dynamics and hence are
thought to represent endpoints of adaptive processes. However, this assessment
is based on situations in which the invasion fitness function determining the
adaptive dynamics have non-zero second derivatives at a CSS. Here we show that
the scope of evolutionary branching can increase if the invasion fitness
function vanishes to higher than first order at a CSS. Using a class of
classical models for frequency-dependent competition, we show that if the
invasion fitness vanishes to higher orders, a CSS may be the starting point for
evolutionary branching, with the only additional requirement that mutant types
need to reach a certain threshold frequency, which can happen e.g. due to
demographic stochasticity. Thus, when invasion fitness functions vanish to
higher than first order at equilibrium points of the adaptive dynamics,
evolutionary diversification can occur even after convergence to an
evolutionarily stable strategy.

control in humans and animals. The introduction of anthelmintic vaccines, as a
complement to or replacement for drug treatments, has been advocated as a
preventive measure. Here, a computer-based simulation, tracking the dynamics of
hosts, parasites and parasite-genes, shows that, depending on the degree of
host-population mixing, the frequency of totally recessive autosomes associated
with anthelmintic resistance can follow either a fast dynamical regime with a
low equilibrium point or a slow dynamical regime with a high equilibrium point.
For fully dominant autosomes, only one regime is predicted. The effectiveness
of anthelminthic vaccines against resistance is shown to be strongly influenced
by the underlying dynamics of resistant autosomes. Vaccines targeting adult
parasites, by decreasing helminth fecundity or lifespan, are predicted to be
more effective than vaccines targeting parasite larvae, by decreasing host
susceptibility to infection, in reducing the spread of resistance. These
results may inform new strategies to prevent, monitor and control the spread of
anthelmintic resistance, including the development of viable anthelmintic
vaccines.

$\frac{dx_i}{dt}= A_i (x)x_i$ where $x_i\in \R^{n_i}$, $x=(x_1,\dots,x_k)$, and
$A_i(x)$ are matrices with non-negative off-diagonal entries. These models are
permanent if there exists a positive global attractor and are robustly
permanent if they remain permanent following perturbations of $A_i(x)$.
Necessary and sufficient conditions for robust permanence are derived using
dominant Lyapunov exponents $\lambda_i(\mu)$ of the $A_i(x)$ with respect to
invariant measures $\mu$. The necessary condition requires $\max_i
\lambda_i(\mu)&gt;0$ for all ergodic measures with support in the boundary of the
non-negative cone. The sufficient condition requires that the boundary admits a
Morse decomposition such that $\max_i \lambda_i(\mu)&gt;0$ for all invariant
measures $\mu$ supported by a component of the Morse decomposition. When the
Morse components are Axiom A, uniquely ergodic, or support all but one
population, the necessary and sufficient conditions are equivalent.
Applications to spatial ecology, epidemiology, and gene networks are given.

  lateral inhibition patterning</title><categories>q-bio.MN</categories><license>http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/</license><abstract>  Lateral inhibition patterns mediated by the Notch-Delta signaling system
occur in diverse developmental contexts. These systems are based on an
intercellular feedback loop in which Notch activation leads to down-regulation
of Delta. However, even in relatively well-characterized systems, the pathway
leading from Notch activation to Delta repression often remains elusive. Recent
work has shown that cis-interactions between Notch and Delta lead to mutual
inactivation of both proteins. Here we show that this type of cis-interaction
enables a simpler and more direct mechanism for lateral inhibition feedback
than those proposed previously. In this mechanism, Notch signaling directly
up-regulates Notch expression, thereby inactivating Delta through the mutual
inactivation of Notch and Delta proteins. This mechanism, which we term
Simplest Lateral Inhibition by Mutual Inactivation (SLIMI), can implement
patterning without requiring any additional genes or regulatory interactions.
Moreover, the key interaction of Notch expression in response to Notch
signaling has been observed in some systems. Stability analysis and simulation
of SLIMI mathematical models show that this lateral inhibition circuit is
capable of pattern formation across a broad range of parameter values. These
results provide a simple and plausible explanation for lateral inhibition
pattern formation during development.

dynamical balance among the competing species. The time-varying populations of
the interacting species are often captured rather well by a set of
deterministic replicator equations in the evolutionary game theory. However,
intrinsic fluctuations arisen from the discreteness of populations lead to
stochastic derivations from the smooth evolution trajectories. The role of
these fluctuations is shown to be critical at causing extinction and
deteriorating the biodiversity of ecosystem. We use children's
rock-paper-scissors game to demonstrate how the intrinsic fluctuations arise
from the discrete populations and why the biodiversity of the ecosystem decays
exponentially, disregarding the detail parameters for competing mechanism and
initial distributions. The dissipative trend in biodiversity can be analogized
to the gradual erosion of kinetic energy of a moving particle due to air drag
or fluid viscosity. The dissipation-fluctuation theorem in statistical physics
seals the fate of these originally conserved quantities. This concept in
physics can be generalized to scrutinize the errors that might be incurred in
the ecological, biological, and quantitative economic modeling for which the
ingredients are all discrete in number.

interplay between evolvability and robustness of model gene regulatory networks
with Boolean threshold dynamics. In agreement with Oikonomou and Cluzel (2006)
we find that networks with SFin topologies, that is SF topology for incoming
nodes and ER topology for outgoing nodes, are significantly more evolvable
towards specific oscillatory targets than networks with ER topology for both
incoming and outgoing nodes. Similar results are found for networks with SFboth
and SFout topologies. The functionality of the SFout topology, which most
closely resembles the structure of biological gene networks (Babu et al.,
2004), is compared to the ER topology in further detail through an extension to
multiple target outputs, with either an oscillatory or a non-oscillatory
nature. For multiple oscillatory targets of the same length, the differences
between SFout and ER networks are enhanced, but for non-oscillatory targets
both types of networks show fairly similar evolvability. We find that SF
networks generate oscillations much more easily than ER networks do, and this
may explain why SF networks are more evolvable than ER networks are for
oscillatory phenotypes. In spite of their greater evolvability, we find that
networks with SFout topologies are also more robust to mutations than ER
networks. Furthermore, the SFout topologies are more robust to changes in
initial conditions (environmental robustness). For both topologies, we find
that once a population of networks has reached the target state, further
neutral evolution can lead to an increase in both the mutational robustness and
the environmental robustness to changes in initial conditions.

cycles superimposed on the long-term trends of the Phanerozoic. We review prior
results and analyze data previously reduced and published. Joint time-series
analysis of various reductions of the Sepkoski Data, Paleobiology Database, and
Fossil Record 2 indicate the same periodicity in biodiversity of marine animals
at 62 Myr. We have not found this periodicity in the terrestrial fossil record.
We have found that the signal strength decreases with time because of the
accumulation of apparently "resistant" long-lived genera. The existence of a
62-Myr periodicity despite very different treatment of systematic error,
particularly sampling-strength biases, in all three major databases strongly
argues for its reality in the fossil record.

unilamellar vesicles (GUVs) can function as a trigger for membrane fission.
When driven through their gel-fluid phase transition GUVs exhibit budding or
pearl formation. These buds remain connected to the mother vesicle presumably
by a small neck. Cooling these vesicles from the fluid phase (T&gt;Tm) through the
phase transition into the gel state (T&lt;Tm), leads to complete rupture and
fission of the neck, while the mother vesicle remains intact. Pearling tubes
which formed upon heating break-up and decay into multiple individual vesicles
which then diffuse freely. Finally we demonstrate that mimicking the
intracellular bulk viscosity by increasing the bulk viscosity to 40cP does not
affect the overall fission process, but leads to a significant decrease in size
of the released vesicles.

household epidemic models in which the infection response may be either mild or
severe, with the type of response also affecting the infectiousness of an
individual. Two different models are analysed. In the first model, the
infection status of an individual is predetermined, perhaps due to partial
immunity, and in the second, the infection status of an individual depends on
the infection status of its infector and on whether the individual was infected
by a within- or between-household contact. The first scenario may be modelled
using a multitype household epidemic model, and the second scenario by a model
we denote by the infector-dependent-severity household epidemic model. Large
population results of the two models are derived, with the focus being on the
distribution of the total numbers of mild and severe cases in a typical
household, of any given size, in the event that the epidemic becomes
established. The aim of the paper is to investigate whether it is possible to
determine which of the two underlying explanations is causing the varying
response when given final size household outbreak data containing mild and
severe cases. We conduct numerical studies which show that, given data on
sufficiently many households, it is generally possible to discriminate between
the two models by comparing the Kullback-Leibler divergence for the two fitted
models to these data.

protein-protein network) and a linguistic network (Moby Thesaurus II) as test
environments. In both networks, the Hirsch index has poor correlation with
Betweenness centrality but correlates well with Eigenvector centrality,
specially for the more important nodes that are relevant for ranking purposes,
say in Search Machine Optimization. In the thesaurus network, the h index seems
even to outperform the Eigenvector centrality measure as evaluated by simple
linguistic criteria.

important research area in the genomics and medical disciplines. Accurate
predicators are necessary for constructing the GRN model and to enable targeted
biological experiments that attempt to confirm or control the regulation
process. In this paper, we implement a SAT-based algorithm to determine the
gene predictor set from steady state gene expression data (attractor states).
Using the attractor states as input, the states are ordered into attractor
cycles. For each attractor cycle ordering, all possible predictors are
enumerated and a CNF expression is formulated which encodes these predictors
and their biological constraints. Each CNF is explored using a SAT solver to
find candidate predictor sets. Statistical analysis of the results selects the
most likely predictor set of the GRN corresponding to the attractor data. We
demonstrate our algorithm on attractor state data from a melanoma study, and
present our predictor set results.

The meaning of a species tree is made more complicated by the recent discovery

desirable to describe uniform well-defined procedures that yield a tree given a
network N. A useful tool toward this end is a connected surjective digraph
(CSD) map f from N to N' where N' is generally a much simpler network than N. A
set W of vertices in N is "restricted" if there is at most one vertex from
which there is an arc into W, thus yielding a bottleneck in N. A CSD map f from
N to N' is "restricted" if the inverse image of each vertex in N' is restricted
in N. This paper describes a uniform procedure that, given a network N, yields
a well-defined tree called the "restricted tree" of N. There is a restricted
CSD map from N to the restricted tree. Many relationships in the tree can be
proved to appear also in N.

Haversian and Volkmann canals contain blood vessels that transport oxygen and

must be taken into account. While it is possible to estimate the value of this
pressure, there is no information on the effect of the vessel wall that may
have in the transmission of pressure.

presentations of the genetic code. The Kronecker family of the genetic matrices
is investigated, which is based on the alphabetical matrix [C A; U G], where C,
A, U, G are the letters of the genetic alphabet. The matrix P=[C A; U G] in the
third Kronecker power is the (8*8)-matrix, which contains 64 triplets.
Peculiarities of the degeneracy of the genetic code are reflected in the
symmetrical black-and-white mosaic of this genetic (8*8)-matrix of 64 triplets.
Phenomena of connections of this mosaic matrix (and many other genetic
matrices) with projection operators are revealed. Taking into account an
important role of projection operators in quantum mechanics, theory of digital
codes, computer science, logic and in many other fields of applied mathematics,
we study algebraic properties and biological meanings of these phenomena. Using
of notions and formalisms of theory of finite-dimensional vector spaces in
bioinformatics and theoretical biology is proposed on the bases of the
described results.

maintain an efficient transport system. As osmotically driven water uptake is
often distal from the tips, and aqueous fluids are incompressible, we propose
that growth induces mass flows across the mycelium, whether or not there are
intrahyphal concentration gradients. We imaged the temporal evolution of
networks formed by Phanerochaete velutina, and at each stage calculated the
unique set of currents that account for the observed changes in cord volume,
while minimising the work required to overcome viscous drag. Predicted speeds
were in reasonable agreement with experimental data, and the pressure gradients
needed to produce these flows are small. Furthermore, cords that were predicted
to carry fast-moving or large currents were significantly more likely to
increase in size than cords with slow-moving or small currents. The
incompressibility of the fluids within fungi means there is a rapid global
response to local fluid movements. Hence velocity of fluid flow is a local
signal that conveys quasi-global information about the role of a cord within
the mycelium. We suggest that fluid incompressibility and the coupling of
growth and mass flow are critical physical features that enable the development
of efficient, adaptive, biological transport networks.

using a novel model of the human brain which incorporates the glial network
into the Hopfield model of the neural network. Our model is based on a
microscopic construction of a quantum Hamiltonian of the synaptic junctions.
Using the Eguchi-Kawai large N reduction, we show that, when the number of
neurons and astrocytes is exponentially large, the degrees of freedom of the
dynamics of the neural and glial networks can be completely removed and,
consequently, that the retention time of the superposition of the wave
functions in the brain is as long as that of the microscopic quantum system of
pre-synaptics sites. Based on this model, the classical information entropy of
the neural-glial network is introduced. Using this quantity, we propose a
criterion for the brain to be a quantum mechanical observer.

strong positive selection. If s is the fitness advantage of a homozygote for
the beneficial allele and h its dominance coefficient, it is usually assumed
that h=1/2, i.e. the beneficial allele is co-dominant. We complement existing
theory for selective sweeps by assuming that h is any value in [0,1]. We show
that genetic diversity patters under selective sweeps with strength s and
dominance 0&lt;h&lt;1 are similar to co-dominant sweeps with selection strength 2hs.
Moreover, we focus on the case h=0 of a completely recessive beneficial allele.
We find that the length of the sweep, i.e. the time from occurrence until
fixation of the beneficial allele, is of the order of sqrt(N/s) generations, if
N is the population size. Simulations as well as our results show that genetic
diversity patterns in the recessive case h=0 greatly differ from all other
cases.

The time scales for extinction can broadly vary and inform on the ecosystem's
stability. We study the spatio-temporal extinction dynamics of a paradigmatic
population model where three species exhibit cyclic competition. The cyclic
dynamics reflects the non-equilibrium nature of the species interactions. While
previous work focusses on the coarsening process as a mechanism that drives the
system to extinction, we found that unexpectedly the dynamics to extinction is
much richer. We observed three different types of dynamics. In addition to
coarsening, in the evolutionary relevant limit of large times, oscillating
traveling waves and heteroclinic orbits play a dominant role. The weight of the
different processes depends on the degree of mixing and the system size. By
analytical arguments and extensive numerical simulations we provide the full
characteristics of scenarios leading to extinction in one of the most
surprising models of ecology.

partially dissimilar sets of moral foundations, thereby reaching different
moral valuations. The use of functional imaging techniques has revealed a
spectrum of cognitive styles with respect to the differential handling of novel
or corroborating information that is correlated to political affiliation. Here
we characterize the collective behavior of an agent-based model whose inter
individual interactions due to information exchange in the form of opinions are
in qualitative agreement with experimental neuroscience data. The main
conclusion derived connects the existence of diversity in the cognitive
strategies and statistics of the sets of moral foundations and suggests that
this connection arises from interactions between agents. Thus a simple
interacting agent model, whose interactions are in accord with empirical data
on conformity and learning processes, presents statistical signatures
consistent with moral judgment patterns of conservatives and liberals as
obtained by survey studies of social psychology.

extending the simulation cycle. Without considering the tendency of seasonal
flu, the simulation does not predict the second peak of the pandemic in the
real world. However, considering the seasonal tendency, the simulation result
predicts the next peak in winter. Thus we consider the seasonal tendency is an
important factor for the spreading of the pandemic.

one of the severest pandemics in history. It is thought that the First World
War much influenced the spread of the pandemic. In this paper, we model the
pandemic considering both civil and military traffic. We propose a hybrid model
to determine how the pandemic spread through the world. Our approach considers
both the SEIR-based model for local areas and the network model for global
connection between countries. First, we reproduce the situation in 12
countries. Then, we simulate another scenario: there was no military traffic
during the pandemic, to determine the influence of the influenced of the war on
the pandemic. By considering the simulation results, we find that the influence
of the war varies in countries; in countries which were deeply involved in the
war, the infections were much influenced by the war, while in countries which
were not much engaged in the war, the infections were not influenced by the
war.

the most widespread pandemics in history. In this paper, we model the pandemic,
considering the effect of the Cold War. There were some restrictions between
Western and Eastern nations due to the Cold War during the pandemic. We expect
that such restrictions influenced the spread of the pandemic. We propose a
hybrid model to determine how the pandemic spread through the world. The model
combines the SEIR-based model for local areas and the network model for global
connection between countries. First, we reproduce the situation in 19
countries. Then, we run another experiment to find the influence of the war in
the spread of the pandemic; simulation considering international relationships
in different years. The simulation results show that the impact of the pandemic
in each country was much influenced by international relationships. This study
indicates that if there was less effect of the Cold War, Western nations would
have larger number of death cases, Eastern nations would have smaller number of
death cases, and the world impact would be increased somewhat.

examine the relative advantage of short dormancy versus long dormancy times in
each case. Simulations and analyses indicate that in planktonic batch cultures
and in chemostats, live biomass is maximized by the fastest possible exit from
dormancy. The lower limit of time to reawakening is thus perhaps governed by
physiological, biochemical or other constraints within the cells. In biofilm we
see that the slower waker has a defensive advantage over the fast waker due to
a larger amount of dormant biomass, without an appreciable difference in total
live biomass. Thus it would seem that typical laboratory culture conditions can
be unrepresentative of the natural state. We discuss the computational methods
developed for this work.

oscillate indefinitely without consuming energy. The question of the number of
possible oscillations and the coherent quality of these oscillations remain
unanswered. This paper proves the upper-bounds on the number and quality of
such oscillations when the system in question is homogeneously driven and has a
discrete network of states. In a closed system, the maximum number of
oscillations is bounded by the number of states in the network. In open
systems, the size of the network bounds the quality factor of oscillation. This
work also explores how the quality factor of macrostate oscillations, such as
would be observed in chemical reactions, are bounded by the smallest equivalent
loop of the network, not the size of the entire system. The consequences of
this limit are explored in the context of chemical clocks and limit cycles.

phenomena in a wide range of fields, from molecular biology to ecology. Since
there is currently no agreed-upon standard way to specify such models it is not
always easy to use published models. Also, since model descriptions are not
usually given in mathematical terms, it is difficult to bring mathematical
analysis tools to bear, so that models are typically studied through
simulation. In order to address this issue, Grimm et al. proposed a protocol
for model specification, the so-called ODD protocol, which provides a standard
way to describe models. This paper proposes an addition to the ODD protocol
which allows the description of an agent-based model as a dynamical system,
which provides access to computational and theoretical tools for its analysis.
The mathematical framework is that of algebraic models, that is, time-discrete
dynamical systems with algebraic structure. It is shown by way of several
examples how this mathematical specification can help with model analysis.

not dispelled this controversy. In this paper, a quantitative approach using
simple mathematics shows that the concept of evolution by natural selection
using only random choice of variables does work. The procedure applied to the
optical equations forming the phenotype of a spider eye produces an eye design
modeled after the measurements by Land and Barth.

measuring spatial concentration differences. The precision of such gradient
sensing is limited by fluctuations in the binding of diffusing particles to
specific receptors on the cell surface. Here, we explore the physical limits of
the spatial sensing mechanism by modeling the chemotactic cell as an Ising spin
chain subject to a spatially varying field. This allows us to derive the
maximum likelihood estimators of the gradient parameters as well as explicit
expressions for their asymptotic uncertainties. The accuracy increases with the
cell's size and our results demonstrate that this accuracy be further increased
by introducing a non-zero cooperativity between neighboring receptors. Thus,
consistent with recent experimental data, it is possible for small bacteria to
perform spatial measurements of gradients.

probability of loss of a chromosome under the neutral Wright-Fisher model with
recombination. I also present an upper and lower bound for this probability.
Exact analytical calculation of this quantity is difficult and computationally
expensive because the number of different ways in which a chromosome can be
lost, grows very large in the presence of recombination. Simulations indicate
that the probabilities obtained using my approximate formula are always
comparable to the true expectations provided that the number of generations
remains small. These results are useful in the context of an algorithm that we
recently developed for simulating Wright-Fisher populations forward in time.
C++ programs that can efficiently calculate these formulas are available on
request.

simultaneously, polymerizing a protein using the mRNA also as the corresponding
template. We define, and analytically calculate, two different measures of the
efficiency of this machine. However, we arugue that its performance is
evaluated better in terms of the translational fidelity and the speed with
which it polymerizes a protein. We define both these quantities and calculate
these analytically. Fidelity is a measure of the quality of the products while
the total quantity of products synthesized in a given interval depends on the
speed of polymerization. We show that for synthesizing a large quantity of
proteins, it is not necessary to sacrifice the quality. We also explore the
effects of the quality control mechanism on the strength of mechano-chemical
coupling. We suggest experiments for testing some of the ideas presented here.

targets affected by many controllers, but these "many-to-many" combinatorial
control systems are poorly understood. Here we analyze distinct cellular
networks (transcription factors, microRNAs, and protein kinases) and a
drug-target network. Certain network properties seem universal across systems
and species, suggesting the existence of common control strategies in biology.
The number of controllers is ~8% of targets and the density of links is 2.5%
\pm 1.2%. Links per node are predominantly exponentially distributed, implying
conservation of the average, which we explain using a mathematical model of
robustness in control networks. These findings suggest that optimal
pharmacological strategies may benefit from a similar, many-to-many
combinatorial structure, and molecular tools are available to test this
approach.

to study the stochastic evolutionary dynamics of finite populations of players
interacting in a repeated prisoner's dilemma game. We show that a mechanism of
amplification of demographic noise can give rise to coherent oscillations in
parameter regimes where deterministic descriptions converge to fixed points
with complex eigenvalues. These quasi-cycles between co-operation and defection
have previously been observed in computer simulations; here we provide a
systematic and comprehensive analytical characterization of their properties.
We are able to predict their power spectra as a function of the mutation rate
and other model parameters, and to compare the relative magnitude of the cycles
induced by different types of underlying microscopic dynamics. We also extend
our analysis to the iterated prisoner's dilemma game with a win-stay lose-shift
strategy, appropriate in situations where players are subject to errors of the
trembling-hand type.

the timescale and final size of infectious disease epidemics. The abundance of
transitive relationships (the number of 3 cliques) in a network and the
variance of the degree distribution are shown to have large effects on the
number ultimately infected and how quickly the epidemic propagates. The network
model is based on a simple generalization of the configuration model, and
epidemic dynamics are modeled with a low dimensional system of ordinary
differential equations. Because of the simplicity of this model, we are able to
explore a large parameter space and characterize dynamics over a wide range of
network topologies. We find that the interaction between clustering and the
degree distribution is complex, and that clustering always slows down an
epidemic, but that simultaneously increasing clustering and variance of the
degree distribution can potentially increase final epidemic size. In contrast
to solutions for unclustered configuration model networks, we find that bond
percolation solutions for the final epidemic size are potentially biased if
they do not take variable infectious periods into account.

evolutionary biology, where phylogenetic trees have been built from DNA data
since the 1960's. In bioinformatics, psychometrics and data mining,
hierarchical clustering techniques output the same mathematical objects, and
practitioners have similar questions about the stability and `generalizability'
of these summaries. This paper provides an implementation of the geometric
distance between trees developed by Billera, Holmes and Vogtmann (2001) [BHV]
equally applicable to phylogenetic trees and hieirarchical clustering trees,
and shows some of the applications in statistical inference for which this
distance can be useful. In particular, since BHV have shown that the space of
trees is negatively curved (a CAT(0) space), a natural representation of a
collection of trees is a tree. We compare this representation to the Euclidean
approximations of treespace made available through Multidimensional Scaling of
the matrix of distances between trees. We also provide applications of the
distances between trees to hierarchical clustering trees constructed from
microarrays. Our method gives a new way of evaluating the influence both of
certain columns (positions, variables or genes) and of certain rows (whether
species, observations or arrays).

axons stimulated by periodic sequence of short current pulses is interpreted
within the Hodgkin-Huxley model. The minimum of the firing rate as a function
of the stimulus amplitude $I_0$ in the high-frequency regime is due to the
multimodal transition. Below this singular point only odd multiples of the
driving period remain and the system is highly sensitive to noise. The
coefficient of variation has a maximum and the firing rate has a minimum as a
function of the noise intensity which is an indication of the stochastic
coherence antiresonance. The model calculations reproduce the frequency of
occurrence of the most common modes in the vicinity of the transition. A linear
relation of output frequency vs. $I_0$ for above the transition is also
confirmed.

alpha-helices and beta-sheets leads to a complex phase behavior in which
proteins can assemble into various types of aggregates including crystals,
liquidlike phases of unfolded or natively folded proteins, and amyloid fibrils.
Here we use a coarse-grained protein model that enables us to perform Monte
Carlo simulations for determining the phase diagram of natively folded
alpha-helical and unfolded beta-sheet forming peptides. The simulations reveal
the existence of various metastable peptide phases. The liquidlike phases are
metastable with respect to the fibrillar phases, and there is a hierarchy of
metastability.

for investigating the interplay of social networks, human mobility and
dynamical processes such as epidemic spreading. Here we analyze data on the
time-resolved face-to-face proximity of individuals in large-scale real-world
scenarios. We compare two settings with very different properties, a scientific
conference and a long-running museum exhibition. We track the behavioral
networks of face-to-face proximity, and characterize them from both a static
and a dynamic point of view, exposing important differences as well as striking
similarities. We use our data to investigate the dynamics of a
susceptible-infected model for epidemic spreading that unfolds on the dynamical
networks of human proximity. The spreading patterns are markedly different for
the conference and the museum case, and they are strongly impacted by the
causal structure of the network data. A deeper study of the spreading paths
shows that the mere knowledge of static aggregated networks would lead to
erroneous conclusions about the transmission paths on the dynamical networks.

structural perturbations, such as ligand binding or detachment, is broadly used
in the studies of protein dynamics. Conformational motions in proteins are
traditionally analyzed in terms of normal modes and experimental data on
thermal fluctuations in such macromolecules is also usually interpreted in
terms of the excitation of normal modes. We have chosen two important protein
motors - myosin V and kinesin KIF1A - and performed numerical investigations of
their conformational relaxation properties within the coarse-grained elastic
network approximation. We have found that the linearity assumption is deficient
for ligand-induced conformational motions and can even be violated for
characteristic thermal fluctuations. The deficiency is particularly pronounced
in KIF1A where the normal mode description fails completely in describing
functional mechanochemical motions. These results indicate that important
assumptions of the theory of protein dynamics may need to be reconsidered.
Neither a single normal mode, nor a superposition of such modes yield an
approximation of strongly nonlinear dynamics.

or making possible for the first time, many analyses, proofs, and derivations,
and offering crucial insights about the way in which the structure of data in
samples from populations depends on the demographic history of the population.
However statistical inference under the coalescent model is extremely
challenging, effectively because no explicit expressions are available for key
sampling probabilities. This led initially to approximation of these
probabilities by ingenious application of modern computationally-intensive
statistical methods. A key breakthrough occurred when Li and Stephens
introduced a different model, similar in spirit to the coalescent, for which
efficient calculations are feasible. In turn, the Li and Stephens model has
changed statistical inference for the wealth of data now available which
documents molecular genetic variation within populations. We briefly review the
coalescent and associated measure-valued diffusions, describe the Li and
Stephens model, and introduce and apply a generalisation of it for inference of
population structure in the presence of linkage disequilibrium.

on population growth at low densities. The Allee effect is a problem in those
populations where the per-capita growth rate at low densities is reduced. We
examine stochastic spatial models in which the reproduction rate changes across
a gradient g so that the population undergoes a 2D-percolation transition.
Without the Allee effect, the transition is continuous and the width w of the
hull scales as in conventional (i.e., uncorrelated) gradient percolation,
proportional to g^(-0.57). However, with a strong Allee effect the transition
is first order and w is proportional to g^(-0.26).

structure in DNA we call a nested tandem repeat (NTR). An NTR is a recurrence
of two or more distinct tandem motifs interspersed with each other. We propose
that nested tandem repeats can be used as phylogenetic and population markers.
We have tested our algorithm on both real and simulated data, and present some
real nested tandem repeats of interest. We discuss how the NTR found in the
ribosomal DNA of taro (Colocasia esculenta) may assist in determining the
cultivation prehistory of this ancient staple food crop. NTRFinder can be

paradigm focusing on the study of adaptive mechanisms to enable or facilitate
intelligent behavior in complex and changing environments. There are several
paradigms of CI [like artificial neural networks, evolutionary computations,
swarm intelligence, artificial immune systems, fuzzy systems and many others],
each of these has its origins in biological systems [biological neural systems,
natural Darwinian evolution, social behavior, immune system, interactions of
organisms with their environment]. Most of those paradigms evolved into
separate machine learning (ML) techniques, where probabilistic methods are used
complementary with CI techniques in order to effectively combine elements of
learning, adaptation, evolution and Fuzzy logic to create heuristic algorithms
that are, in some sense, intelligent. The current trend is to develop consensus
techniques, since no single machine learning algorithms is superior to others
in all possible situations. In order to overcome this problem several
meta-approaches were proposed in ML focusing on the integration of results from
different methods into single prediction. We discuss here the Landau theory for
the nonlinear equation that can describe the adaptive integration of
information acquired from an ensemble of independent learning agents. The
influence of each individual agent on other learners is described similarly to
the social impact theory. The final decision outcome for the consensus system
is calculated using majority rule in the stationary limit, yet the minority
solutions can survive inside the majority population as the complex
intermittent clusters of opposite opinion.

large aggregate's, Parkinson's and other neurological and systemic diseases.
The overall process of protein aggregation is characterized by initial lag time
during which no detectable aggregation occurs in the solution and by maximal
aggregation rate at which the dissolved protein converts into aggregates. In
this study, the correlation between the lag time and the maximal rate of
protein aggregation is analyzed. It is found that the product of these two
quantities depends on a single numerical parameter, the kinetic index of the
curve quantifying the time evolution of the fraction of protein aggregated. As
this index depends relatively little on the conditions and/or system studied,
our finding provides insight into why for many experiments the values of the
product of the lag time and the maximal aggregation rate are often equal or
quite close to each other. It is shown how the kinetic index is related to a
basic kinetic parameter of a recently proposed theory of protein aggregation.

by the mechanism of direct polymerization of practically fully extended protein
segments, i.e. beta-strands, into beta-sheets. Applying the classical
nucleation theory, we derive a general expression for the work to form a
nanosized amyloid fibril (protofilament) constituted of successively layered
beta-sheets. Analysis of this expression reveals that with increasing its size,
the fibril transforms from one-dimensional into two-dimensional aggregate in
order to preserve the equilibrium shape corresponding to minimal formation
work. We determine the size of the fibril nucleus, the fibril nucleation work
and the fibril nucleation rate as explicit functions of the concentration and
temperature of the protein solution. The results obtained are applicable to
homogeneous nucleation which occurs when the solution is sufficiently pure
and/or strongly supersaturated.

in a region for which data are missing, but which is at work as a disease
spreader. Node discovery for the spread of an infectious disease is defined as
discriminating between the nodes which are neighboring to a missing disease
spreader node, and the rest, given a dataset on the number of cases. The spread
is described by stochastic differential equations. A perturbation theory
quantifies the impact of the missing spreader on the moments of the number of
cases. Statistical discriminators examine the mid-body or tail-ends of the
probability density function, and search for the disturbance from the missing
spreader. They are tested with computationally synthesized datasets, and
applied to the SARS outbreak and flu pandemic.

molecule manipulation experiments, where molecule stretching plays a primary
role. In order to understand the experimental data, it is felt the urge of some
physical and mathematical models to quantitatively express the mechanical
properties of the observed molecules. In this paper we reconsider a simple
phenomenological model which reproduces the behaviour of single and double
stranded DNA under tension. The problem is easily solved via the cavity method
both in the small forces range and in presence of overstretching transition, so
that some properties such as bending stiffness and elasticity of DNA emerge in
a very clear manner. Our theoretical findings are successfully fitted to real
measurements and compared to Monte Carlo simulations, confirming the quality of
the approach.

majority of comparative genomics studies our understanding of alignment biases
still needs to be improved. To infer true structural or homologous regions
computational alignments need further evaluation. It has been shown that the
accuracy of aligned positions can drop substantially in particular around gaps.
Here we focus on re-evaluation of score-based alignments with affine gap
penalty costs. We exploit their relationships with pair hidden Markov models
and develop efficient algorithms by which to identify gaps which are
significant in terms of length and multiplicity. We evaluate our statistics
with respect to the well-established structural alignments from SABmark and
find that indel reliability substantially increases with their significance in
particular in worst-case twilight zone alignments. This points out that our
statistics can reliably complement other methods which mostly focus on the
reliability of match positions.

consumer-resource system with annual character of the behavior. Namely,
individuals are active during seasons of fixed length separated by winter
periods. All individuals die at the end of the season and the size of the next
generation is determined by the number of offspring produced during the past
season. The rate at which the consumers produce immature offspring depends on
their internal energy which can be increased by feeding. The reproduction of
the resource simply occurs at a constant rate. At the beginning, we consider a
population of consumers maximizing their common fitness, all consumers being
individuals having the same goal function and acting for the common good. We
suppose that a small fraction of the consumer population may appear at the
beginning of one season and start to behave as mutants in the main population.
We study how such invasion occurs.

resource. The individuals in the population choose a strategy that defines how
they use their available time over the course of their life for feeding, for
reproducing (say laying eggs), or split their energy in between these two
activities. We here suppose that their life lasts a full season, so that the
chosen strategy results in the production of a certain number of eggs laid over
the season. This number then helps define the long-run evolution of the
population since the eggs constitute the basis for the population for the next
season. However, in this paper, we strictly concentrate on what occurs within a
season, by considering two possible strategies: the collective optimum and the
uninvadable strategy. The (collective) optimal strategy involves a singular
arc, which has some resource saving feature and may, on the long-term, lead to
an equilibrium. However, it is susceptible to invasion by a greedy mutant which
free-rides on this resource saving strategy. Therefore, the "optimal" strategy
is not evolutionarily stable. We thus look for an evolutionarily stable
strategy, using the first ESS condition ("Nash-Wardrop condition"). This yields
a different singular arc and a strategy that conserves less the resource.
Unfortunately, we show in a forthcoming paper that, though it is an ESS, it is
not long-term (interseasonal) sustainable. This is an instance of the classical
"tragedy of the commons". In this paper we also investigate whether the mixed
strategy on the singular arcs may be interpreted in terms of population shares
using pure strategies. The answer is negative.

advance in genomic studies, offering new prospects in a wide range of
applications. We propose a rigorous and flexible algorithmic solution to
mapping SOLiD color-space reads to a reference genome. The solution relies on
an advanced method of seed design that uses a faithful probabilistic model of
read matches and, on the other hand, a novel seeding principle especially
adapted to read mapping. Our method can handle both lossy and lossless
frameworks and is able to distinguish, at the level of seed design, between
SNPs and reading errors. We illustrate our approach by several seed designs and
demonstrate their efficiency.

From
the most general definition of autocatalysis, that is a process in which a
chemical compound is able to catalyze its own formation, several different
systems can be described. We detail the different categories of autocatalyses,
and compare them on the basis of their mechanistic, kinetic, and dynamic
properties. It is shown how autocatalytic patterns can be generated by
different systems of chemical reactions. The notion of autocatalysis covering a
large variety of mechanistic realisations with very similar behaviors, it is
proposed that the key signature of autocatalysis is its kinetic pattern
expressed in a mathematical form.

protein concentrations is compared to a Boolean model for gene activity. Using
a generalized method, we study within a single framework different continuous
models and different types of regulatory functions, and establish conditions
under which the system can display stable oscillations. These conditions
concern the time scales, the degree of cooperativity of the regulating
interactions, and the signs of the interactions. Not all models that show
oscillations under Boolean dynamics can have oscillations under continuous
dynamics, and vice versa.

the structure and dynamics of these protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks
are the key to the functional understanding of cells. In the last years,
large-scale PPI networks of several model organisms were investigated.
Methodological improvements now allow the analysis of PPI networks of multiple
organisms simultaneously as well as the direct modeling of ancestral networks.
This provides the opportunity to challenge existing assumptions on network
evolution. We utilized present-day PPI networks from integrated datasets of
seven model organisms and developed a theoretical and bioinformatic framework
for studying the evolutionary dynamics of PPI networks. A novel filtering
approach using percolation analysis was developed to remove low confidence
interactions based on topological constraints. We then reconstructed the
ancient PPI networks of different ancestors, for which the ancestral proteomes,
as well as the ancestral interactions, were inferred. Ancestral proteins were
reconstructed using orthologous groups on different evolutionary levels. A
stochastic approach, using the duplication-divergence model, was developed for
estimating the probabilities of ancient interactions from today's PPI networks.
The growth rates for nodes, edges, sizes and modularities of the networks
indicate multiplicative growth and are consistent with the results from
independent static analysis. Our results support the duplication-divergence
model of evolution and indicate fractality and multiplicative growth as general
properties of the PPI network structure and dynamics.

important unsolved problems of molecular biology and biophysics.Not only would
a successful prediction algorithm be a tremendous advance in the understanding
of the biochemical mechanisms of proteins, but, since such an algorithm could
conceivably be used to design proteins to carry out specific
functions.Prediction of the secondary structure of a protein (alpha-helix,
beta-sheet, coil) is an important step towards elucidating its three
dimensional structure as well as its function. In this research, we use
different Hidden Markov models for protein secondary structure prediction. In
this paper we have proposed an algorithm for predicting protein secondary
structure. We have used Hidden Markov model with sliding window for secondary
structure prediction.The secondary structure has three regular forms, for each
secondary structural element we are using one Hidden Markov Model.

Brazilian escorts and sex-buyers for the spreading of sexually transmitted
infections (STI). Despite a highly skewed degree distribution diseases
spreading in this contact structure have rather well-defined epidemic
thresholds. Temporal effects create a broad distribution of outbreak sizes even
if the transmission probability is taken to the hypothetical value of 100%.
Temporal correlations speed up outbreaks, especially in the early phase,
compared to randomized contact structures. The time-ordering and the network
topology, on the other hand, slow down the epidemics. Studying compartmental
models we show that the contact structure can probably not support the spread
of HIV, not even if individuals were sexually active during the acute
infection. We investigate hypothetical means of containing an outbreak and find
that travel restrictions are about as efficient as removal of the vertices of
highest degree. In general, the type of commercial sex we study seems not like
a major factor in STI epidemics.

biology because cooperation is undermined by selfish cheaters (or "free
riders") that profit from cooperators but do not invest any resources
themselves. In a purely "selfish" view of evolution, those cheaters should be
favored. Evolutionary game theory has been able to show that under certain
conditions, cooperation nonetheless evolves stably. One of these scenarios
utilizes the power of punishment to suppress free riders, but only if players
interact in a structured population where cooperators are likely to be
surrounded by other cooperators. Here we show that cooperation via punishment
can evolve even in well-mixed populations that play the "public goods" game, if
the synergy effect of cooperation is high enough. As the synergy is increased,
populations transition from defection to cooperation in a manner reminiscent of
a phase transition. If punishment is turned off, the critical synergy is
significantly higher, illustrating that (as shown before) punishment aids in
establishing cooperation. We also show that the critical point depends on the
mutation rate so that higher mutation rates discourage cooperation, as has been
observed before in the Prisoner's Dilemma.

to the fitness landscape it inhabits. As a consequence, evolutionary dynamics
is shaped, constrained, and channeled, by that fitness landscape. Much work has
been expended to understand the evolutionary dynamics of adapting populations,
but much less is known about the structure of the landscapes. Here, we study
the global and local structure of complex fitness landscapes of interacting
loci that describe protein folds or sets of interacting genes forming pathways
or modules. We find that in these landscapes, high peaks are more likely to be
found near other high peaks, corroborating Kauffman's "Massif Central"
hypothesis. We study the clusters of peaks as a function of the ruggedness of
the landscape and find that this clustering allows peaks to form interconnected
networks. These networks undergo a percolation phase transition as a function
of minimum peak height, which indicates that evolutionary trajectories that
take no more than two mutations to shift from peak to peak can span the entire
genetic space. These networks have implications for evolution in rugged
landscapes, allowing adaptation to proceed after a local fitness peak has been
ascended.

(Oncorhynchus nerka) that return to their native stream within the Fraser River
basin in Canada are a striking example of population oscillations. The period
of the oscillation corresponds to the dominant generation time of these fish.
Various - not fully convincing - explanations for these oscillations have been
proposed, including stochastic influences, depensatory fishing, or genetic
effects. Here, we show that the oscillations can be explained as a stable
dynamical attractor of the population dynamics, resulting from a strong
resonance near a Neimark Sacker bifurcation. This explains not only the
long-term persistence of these oscillations, but also reproduces correctly the
empirical sequence of salmon abundance within one period of the oscillations.
Furthermore, it explains the observation that these oscillations occur only in
sockeye stocks originating from large oligotrophic lakes, and that they are
usually not observed in salmon species that have a longer generation time.

non-coding RNAs and plays a crucial role in a number of regulatory processes.
Recently several MFE folding algorithms for predicting the joint structure of
two interacting RNA molecules have been proposed. Here joint structure means
that in a diagram representation the intramolecular bonds of each partner are
pseudoknot-free, that the intermolecular binding pairs are noncrossing, and
that there is no so-called ``zig-zag'' configuration. This paper presents the
combinatorics of RNA interaction structures including their generating
function, singularity analysis as well as explicit recurrence relations. In
particular, our results imply simple asymptotic formulas for the number of
joint structures.

several decades. Recently, theoretical models and experimental evidence show
that costly punishment may facilitate cooperation in human societies, but may
not be used by winners. The puzzle how the costly punishment behaviour evolves
can be solved under voluntary participation. Could the punishers emerge if
participation is compulsory? Is the punishment inevitably a selfish behaviour
or an altruistic behaviour? The motivations behind punishment are still an
enigma. Based on public goods interactions, we present a model in which just a
certain portion of the public good is divided equally among all members. The
other portion is distributed to contributors when paying a second cost.
Contributors who are willing to pay a second cost can be costly (and then
altruistic) punishers, but they can also flourish or dominate the population,
in this case we may call them "advantageous punishers". We argue that most of
successful cooperators and punishers in nature are advantageous punishers, and
costly punishment mostly happens in humans. This indicates a universal
surviving rule: contributing more and gaining more. Our models show
theoretically that the original motivation behind punishment is to retrieve
deserved payoff from their own contributions, a selfish incentive.

noise, inducing effects which are not present in deterministic systems,
including fixation and extinction. In the first part of this paper we
investigate the phenomenon of drift reversal in finite populations, taking into
account that drift is a local quantity in strategy space. Secondly, we study a
simple imitation dynamics, and show that it can lead to fixation at internal
mixed-strategy fixed points even in finite populations. Imitation in infinite
populations is adequately described by conventional replicator dynamics, and
these equations are known to have internal fixed points. Internal absorption in
finite populations on the other hand is a novel dynamic phenomenon. Due to an
outward drift in finite populations this type of dynamic arrest is not found in
other commonly studied microscopic dynamics, not even in those with the same
deterministic replicator limit as imitation.

introduced to set up a theoretical framework for statistical analysis of (real,
complex and real quaternion) stochastic time series representing two "remote"
complex systems. The first paper in a series provides a detailed spectral
theory of non-Hermitean Wishart random matrices composed of complex valued
entries. The great emphasis is placed on an asymptotic analysis of the mean
eigenvalue density for which we derive, among other results, a complex-plane
analogue of the Marchenko-Pastur law. A surprising connection with a class of
matrix models previously invented in the context of quantum chromodynamics is
pointed out.

describe evolutionary histories of species. The Tree Containment problem asks
whether a given phylogenetic tree is embedded in a given phylogenetic network.
Given a phylogenetic network and a cluster of species, the Cluster Containment
problem asks whether the given cluster is a cluster of some phylogenetic tree
embedded in the network. Both problems are known to be NP-complete in general.
In this article, we consider the restriction of these problems to several
well-studied classes of phylogenetic networks. We show that Tree Containment is
polynomial-time solvable for normal networks, for binary tree-child networks,
and for level-$k$ networks. On the other hand, we show that, even for
tree-sibling, time-consistent, regular networks, both Tree Containment and
Cluster Containment remain NP-complete.

growth and mixing phases have lower asymptotic growth with greater mixing. Here
this result is extended to linear differential equations that combine
site-specific growth or decay rates, and mixing between sites, showing that the
spectral abscissa of a matrix D + m A decreases with m, where D does-not-equal
c I is a real diagonal matrix, A is an irreducible matrix with non-negative
off-diagonal elements (an ML- or essentially non-negative matrix), and m &gt;= 0.
The result is based on the inequality: u' A v &lt; r(A), where u and v are the
left and right Perron vectors of the matrix D + A, and r(A) is the spectral
abscissa and Perron root of A. The result gives an analytic solution to prior
work that relied on two-site or numerical simulation of models of growth and
mixing, such as source and sink ecological models, or multiple tissue
compartment models of microbe growth. The result has applications to the
Lyapunov stability of perturbations in nonlinear systems.

diversification and enrichment of mammalian transcriptomes through various
mechanisms such as exonization and intronization (the birth of new
exons/introns from previously intronic/exonic sequences, respectively), and
insertion into first and last exons. However, no extensive analysis has
compared the effects of TEs on the transcriptomes of mammalian, non-mammalian
vertebrates and invertebrates. Results: We analyzed the influence of TEs on the
transcriptomes of five species, three invertebrates and two non-mammalian
vertebrates. Compared to previously analyzed mammals, there were lower levels
of TE introduction into introns, significantly lower numbers of exonizations
originating from TEs and a lower percentage of TE insertion within the first
and last exons. Although the transcriptomes of vertebrates exhibit a
significant level of exonizations of TEs, only anecdotal cases were found in
invertebrates. In vertebrates, as in mammals, the exonized TEs are mostly
alternatively spliced, indicating selective pressure maintains the original
mRNA product generated from such genes. Conclusions: Exonization of TEs is
wide-spread in mammals, less so in non- mammalian vertebrates, and very low in
invertebrates. We assume that the exonization process depends on the length of
introns. Vertebrates, unlike invertebrates, are characterized by long introns
and short internal exons. Our results suggest that there is a direct link
between the length of introns and exonization of TEs and that this process
became more prevalent following the appearance of mammals.

important contributor to mammalian evolution and speciation. Insertion of
transposed elements into introns can lead to their activation as alternatively
spliced cassette exons, an event called exonization. Elucidation of the
evolutionary constraints that have shaped fixation of transposed elements
within human and mouse protein coding genes and subsequent exonization is
important for understanding of how the exonization process has affected
transcriptome and proteome complexities. Here we show that exonization of
transposed elements is biased towards the beginning of the coding sequence in
both human and mouse genes. Analysis of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs)
revealed that exonization of transposed elements can be population-specific,
implying that exonizations may enhance divergence and lead to speciation. SNP
density analysis revealed differences between Alu and other transposed
elements. Finally, we identified cases of primate-specific Alu elements that
depend on RNA editing for their exonization. These results shed light on TE
fixation and the exonization process within human and mouse genes.

of a pattern in a long sequence. Both approaches take into account the sparse
structure of the problem and are two-part algorithms. The first approach relies
on a partial recursion after a fast computation of the second largest
eigenvalue of the transition matrix of a Markov chain embedding. The second
approach uses fast Taylor expansions of an exact bivariate rational
reconstruction of the distribution. We illustrate the interest of both
approaches on a simple toy-example and two biological applications: the
transcription factors of the Human Chromosome 5 and the PROSITE signatures of
functional motifs in proteins. On these example our methods demonstrate their
complementarity and their hability to extend the domain of feasibility for
exact computations in pattern problems to a new level.

by innate language-specific biases, or acquired through cognition-general
principles. Here we examine the probabilistic language acquisition hypothesis
on three levels: We outline a novel theoretical result showing that it is
possible to learn the exact generative model underlying a wide class of
languages, purely from observing samples of the language. We then describe a
recently proposed practical framework, which quantifies natural language
learnability, allowing specific learnability predictions to be made for the
first time. In previous work, this framework was used to make learnability
predictions for a wide variety of linguistic constructions, for which
learnability has been much debated. Here, we present a new experiment which
tests these learnability predictions. We find that our experimental results
support the possibility that these linguistic constructions are acquired
probabilistically from cognition-general principles.

consistent with experiments and previous computational studies. Moreover, the
simplicity of the model allows us to probe the biologically relevant low force
regime, where we predict the existence of two intermediates with very close
elongations. The unfolding pathway is characterized by stochastic transitions
between these two intermediates.

  (ICARIS) 2010</journal-ref><license>http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/</license><abstract>  The Natural Immune System (NIS) is a distributed system that solves
challenging search and response problems while operating under constraints
imposed by physical space and resource availability. Remarkably, NIS search and
response times do not scale appreciably with the physical size of the animal in
which its search is conducted. Many distributed systems are engineered to solve
analogous problems, and the NIS demonstrates how such engineered systems can
achieve desirable scalability. We hypothesize that the architecture of the NIS,
composed of a hierarchical decentralized detection network of lymph nodes (LN)
facilitates efficient search and response. A sub-modular architecture in which
LN numbers and size both scale with organism size is shown to efficiently
balance tradeoffs between local antigen detection and global antibody
production, leading to nearly scale-invariant detection and response. We
characterize the tradeoffs as balancing local and global communication and show
that similar tradeoffs exist in distributed systems like LN inspired artificial
immune system (AIS) applications and peer-to-peer (P2P) systems. Taking
inspiration from the architecture of the NIS, we propose a modular RADAR
(Robust Adaptive Decentralized search with Automated Response) strategy for
distributed systems. We demonstrate how two existing distributed systems (a LN
inspired multi-robot control application and a P2P system) can be improved by a
modular RADAR strategy. Such a sub-modular architecture is shown to balance the
tradeoffs between local communication (within artificial LNs and P2P clusters)
and global communication (between artificial LNs and P2P clusters), leading to
efficient search and response.

averaging of the microscopic equations, we discuss the electrophysiology of
living organs. Other methods of averaging (or homogenization) like the bidomain
model are not compatible with Maxwell's theory. We also point out that modeling
the active cells by source currents is not a suitable description of the
situation from first principles. Instead, it turns out that the main source of
the measured electrical potentials is the polarization charge density which
exists at the membranes of the active cells and adds up to a macroscopic
polarization. The latter is the source term in the Laplace equation, the
solution of which gives the measured far-field potential. As a consequence it
is the polarization or dipole density which is best suited for localization of
cardiac arrhythmia.

are known to dictate rhythms of approximately 24 hours (circa diem) to many
physiological processes. This includes metabolism (e.g., temperature, hormonal
blood levels) and cell proliferation. It has been observed in tumor-bearing
laboratory rodents that a severe disruption of these physiological rhythms
results in accelerated tumor growth. The question of accurately representing
the control exerted by circadian clocks on healthy and tumour tissue
proliferation to explain this phenomenon has given rise to mathematical
developments, which we review. The main goal of these previous works was to
examine the influence of a periodic control on the cell division cycle in
physiologically structured cell populations, comparing the effects of periodic
control with no control, and of different periodic controls between them. We
state here a general convexity result that may give a theoretical justification
to the concept of cancer chronotherapeutics. Our result also leads us to
hypothesize that the above mentioned effect of disruption of circadian rhythms
on tumor growth enhancement is indirect, that, is this enhancement is likely to
result from the weakening of healthy tissue that are at work fighting tumor
growth.

essentially catalytic reaction pathway: one which is on in the presence of
certain catalysts and off in their absence. We show that examples of catalytic
networks include synthetic DNA molecular circuits that have been shown to
perform signal amplification and molecular logic. Recall that a critical siphon
is a subset of the species in a chemical reaction network whose absence is
forward invariant and stoichiometrically compatible with a positive point. Our
main theorem is that all weakly-reversible networks with critical siphons are
catalytic. Consequently, we obtain new proofs for the persistence of atomic
event-systems of Adleman et al., and normal networks of Gnacadja. We define
autocatalytic networks, and conjecture that a weakly-reversible reaction
network has critical siphons if and only if it is autocatalytic.

quenched and annealed disorder and conclude that the former cannot always be
reduced to a simple change in the stiffness of the pure system. We also discuss
the effect of a random transverse force on the stretching response of a
wormlike chain without spontaneous curvature.

62 My periodicity in terrestrial fossil biodiversity. It has been suggested
that the infall of our galaxy toward the Virgo cluster could generate an
extragalactic shock, accelerating charged particles and exposing the earth to a
flux of high energy cosmic rays (HECRs). The oscillation of the Sun
perpendicular to the galactic plane could induce 62 My periodicity in the HECR
flux on the Earth, with a magnitude much higher than the Galactic cosmic ray
change we see in a solar cycle. This mechanism could potentially explain the
observed 62 My periodicity in terrestrial biodiversity over the past 500 My. In
addition to direct effects on life from secondaries, HECRs induced air showers
ionize the atmosphere leading to changes in atmospheric chemistry and
microphysical processes that can lead to cloud formation including low altitude
cloud cover. An increase in ionization changes the global electric circuit
which could enhance the formation of cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) through
microphysical processes such as electroscavenging and ion mediated nucleation,
leading to an increase in the cloud cover. This could increase the albedo and
reduce the solar flux reaching the ground, reducing the global temperature.
Using an existing model, we have calculated the enhancement in atmospheric
ionization at low altitudes resulting from exposure to HECRs. We use a
conservative model to estimate the change in low altitude cloud cover from this
increased ionization.

"the [Bayesian] inference is mathematically incorrect and formally illogical".
Since those criticisms turn out to be bearing on Bayesian foundations rather
than on the computational methodology they are primarily directed at, we
endeavour to point out in this note the statistical errors and inconsistencies
in Templeton (2010), refering to Beaumont et al. (2010) for a reply that is
broader in scope since it also covers the phylogenetic aspects of nested clade
versus a model-based approach.

Kinesins, the average velocity and current undergo notable decrease which is
due to formation of traffic jams in the system.

the joint structure of two interacting RNA molecules have been proposed. Their
folding targets are interaction structures, that can be represented as diagrams
with two backbones drawn horizontally on top of each other such that (1)
intramolecular and intermolecular bonds are noncrossing and (2) there is no
"zig-zag" configuration. This paper studies joint structures with arc-length at
least four in which both, interior and exterior stack-lengths are at least two
(no isolated arcs). The key idea in this paper is to consider a new type of
shape, based on which joint structures can be derived via symbolic enumeration.
Our results imply simple asymptotic formulas for the number of joint structures
with surprisingly small exponential growth rates. They are of interest in the
context of designing prediction algorithms for RNA-RNA interactions.

been used as a basis for both equilibrium sampling (via "library-based Monte
Carlo") and for obtaining absolute free energies using a polymer-growth
formalism. Here, we combine the two approaches to extend the size of systems
for which free energies can be calculated. We study a series of all-atom
poly-alanine systems in a simple dielectric "solvent" and find that precise
free energies can be obtained rapidly. For instance, for 12 residues, less than
an hour of single-processor is required. The combined approach is formally
equivalent to the "annealed importance sampling" algorithm; instead of
annealing by decreasing temperature, however, interactions among fragments are
gradually added as the molecule is "grown." We discuss implications for future
binding affinity calculations in which a ligand is grown into a binding site.

of protein levels across a population of cells. Variability (or noise) in
protein distributions can be modulated by cellular mechanisms of gene
regulation; in particular, there is considerable interest in understanding the
role of post-transcriptional regulation. To address this issue, we propose and
analyze a stochastic model for post-transcriptional regulation of gene
expression. The analytical solution of the model provides insight into the
effects of different mechanisms of post-transcriptional regulation on the noise
in protein distributions. The results obtained also demonstrate how different
sources of intrinsic noise in gene expression can be discriminated based on
observations of regulated protein distributions.

non-diabetic end stage kidney disease (ESKD). We use recently released
sequences from the 1000 Genomes Project to identify two western African
specific missense mutations (S342G and I384M) in the neighbouring APOL1 gene,
and demonstrate that these are more strongly associated with ESKD than
previously reported MYH9 variants. We also show that the distribution of these
risk variants in African populations is consistent with the pattern of African
ancestry ESKD risk previously attributed to the MYH9 gene. Additional
associations were also found among other members of the APOL gene family, and
we propose that ESKD risk is caused by western African variants in members of
the APOL gene family, which evolved to confer protection against pathogens,
such as Trypanosoma.

information. We take a physicist's approach of looking for simple
phenomenological descriptions that can address the questions of biological
function without necessarily modeling all (mostly unknown) microscopic details;
the example that is developed throughout the notes is transcriptional
regulation in genetic regulatory networks. We present tools from information
theory and statistical physics that can be used to analyze noisy nonlinear
biological networks, and build generative and predictive models of regulatory
processes.

This
epidemiologic disease is an important theme in tropical countries due to the
growing number of infected individuals. The dynamic model is described by a set
of nonlinear ordinary differential equations, that depend on the dynamic of the
Dengue mosquito, the number of infected individuals, and the people's
motivation to combat the mosquito. The cost functional depends not only on the
costs of medical treatment of the infected people but also on the costs related
to educational and sanitary campaigns. Two approaches to solve the problem are
considered: one using optimal control theory, another one by discretizing first
the problem and then solving it with nonlinear programming. The results
obtained with OC-ODE and IPOPT solvers are given and discussed. We observe that
with current computational tools it is easy to obtain, in an efficient way,
better solutions to Dengue problems, leading to a decrease of infected
mosquitoes and individuals in less time and with lower costs.

important role in the evolution of viruses, it is not clear how it generates
diversity. {\it Geminiviruses} are plant viruses which have ambisense
single-stranded circular DNA genomes and one of the most economically important
plant viruses in agricultural production. Small circular single-stranded DNA
satellites, termed DNA-$\beta$, have recently been found associated with some
geminivirus infections. In this paper we analyze a satellite molecule
DNA-$\beta$ of geminiviruses for recombination events using phylogenetic and
statistical analysis and we find that one strain from ToLCMaB has a
recombination pattern and is possibly recombinant molecule between two strains
from two species, PaLCuB-[IN:Chi:05] (major parent) and ToLCB-[IN:CP:04] (minor
parent).

on the square lattice motivated by population biology. The model is an
extension of the contact process, and the three states correspond to an empty
site, a host, and a parasite. We determine the phase diagram of the model by
scaling analysis. In agreement with previous results, three phases are
identified: the phase in which both hosts and parasites are extinct (S_{0}),
the phase in which hosts survive but parasites are extinct (S_{01}), and the
phase in which both hosts and parasites survive (S_{012}). We argue that both
the S_{0}-S_{01} and S_{01}-S_{012} boundaries belong to the directed
percolation class. In this model, it has been suggested that an excessively
large reproduction rate of parasites paradoxically extinguishes hosts and
parasites and results in S_{0}. We show that this paradoxical extinction is a
finite size effect; the corresponding parameter region is likely to disappear
in the limit of infinite system size.

study consumption data observed in trophic food webs. These data describe the
feeding volume (non-negative) among organisms grouped into nodes, called
trophic species, that form the food web. Model complexity arises due to the
extensive amount of zeros in the data, as each node in the web is predator/prey
to only a small number of other trophic species. Many of the zeros are regarded
as structural (non-random) in the context of feeding behavior. The presence of
basal prey and top predator nodes (those who never consume and those who are
never consumed, with probability 1) creates additional complexity to the
statistical modeling. We develop a special statistical social network model to
account for such network features. The model is applied to two empirical food
webs; focus is on the web for which the population size of seals is of concern
to various commercial fisheries.

are conditional on one- two- and three-motif prevalences. Interpretations of
these real parameters are presented that motivate a set of rewiring schemes to
create appropriately clustered networks. Finally, the dynamical implications of
higher order structure, as parameterised, for a contact process are considered.

physical observables along the constrained subspace when flexible constraints
are imposed on the system (i.e., constraints in which the hard coordinates are
fixed to configuration-dependent values). The presented scheme is exact, it
does not contain any tunable parameter, and it only requires the calculation
and inversion of a sub-block of the Hessian matrix of second derivatives of the
function through which the constraints are defined. We also present a practical
application to the case in which the sought observables are the Euclidean
coordinates of complex molecular systems, and the function whose minimization
defines the constraints is the potential energy. Finally, and in order to
validate the method, which, as far as we are aware, is the first of its kind in
the literature, we compare it to the natural and straightforward
finite-differences approach in three molecules of biological relevance:
methanol, N-methyl-acetamide and a tri-glycine peptide

LH2 complex from Rhodopseudomonas acidophila, a non-sulfur purple bacteria that
has the ability of producing chemical energy from photosynthesis. The
electronic structure calculations indicate that the transmembrane helices of
these peptides are characterized by dipole moments with a magnitude of ~150 D.
When the full nonamer assembly made of eighteen peptides is considered, then a
macrodipole of magnitude 704 D is built up from the vector sum of each monomer
dipole. The macrodipole is oriented normal to the membrane plane and with the
positive tip toward the cytoplasm thereby indicating that the electronic charge
of the protein scaffold is polarized toward the periplasm. The results obtained
here suggest that the asymmetric charge distribution of the protein scaffold
contributes an anisotropic electrostatic environment which differentiates the
absorption properties of the bacteriochlorophyll pigments, B800 and B850,
embedded in the LH2 complex.

follow media reports of the outbreak and take steps, including self-isolation,
to protect themselves from infection and possibly death. Self-isolation can
take many forms including restricting local and long-distance travel, using
face masks, and choosing to receive a vaccine. We use mathematical modeling to
show that public health agencies working together with the media can
significantly decrease the severity of an outbreak by providing timely and
accurate accounts of the numbers of new infections and deaths. Our model also
shows that although providing such information beginning as early as possible
is best, even starting to provide it well into the course of an outbreak can
significantly reduce the severity of the outbreak. We illustrate our results
with a simulated outbreak of Ebola Hemorrhagic Fever in the town of Huntington,
West Virginia (population about 50, 000).

antibodies can directly kill cancerous cells [1]. The existence of
transcritical and saddle-node bifurcation, which has been proved using

simulations, it has been illustrated that under certain therapy (like
monoclonal antibody therapy), which is capable of altering the parameters of
the system, cancer-free state can be obtained.

Looping Sequences (CLS). While keeping the same expressiveness, CWC strongly
simplifies the development of automatic tools for the analysis of biological
systems. The main simplification consists in the removal of the sequencing
operator, thus lightening the formal treatment of the patterns to be matched in
a term (whose complexity in CLS is strongly affected by the variables matching
in the sequences).
  We define a stochastic semantics for this new calculus. As an application we
model the interaction between macrophages and apoptotic neutrophils and a
mechanism of gene regulation in E.Coli.

  piecewise regression</title><categories>stat.AP q-bio.TO</categories><license>http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/</license><abstract>  Transition points are common in physiological processes. However the
transition between normothermia and hypothermia during haemorrhagic shock has
rarely been systematically quantified from intensive time series data. We
estimated the critical transition point (CTP) and provided confidence intervals
for core body temperature response to acute severe haemorrhage in a conscious
rat model. Estimates were obtained by traditional piecewise linear regression
(broken stick model) and compared to those from the more novel bent cable
regression. Bent cable regression relaxes the assumption of an abrupt point
transition, and thus allows the capture of a potentially gradual transition
phase; the broken stick is a special case of the bent cable model. We
calculated two types of confidence intervals, assuming either independent or
autoregressive structure for the residuals. In spite of the severity of the
haemorrhage, median temperature change was minor (0.8 C; IQR 0.57-1.31 C) and
only four of 38 rats were clinically hypothermic (core temperature &lt; 35 C).
However, a transition could be estimated for 23 rats. Bent cable fits were
superior when the transition appeared to be gradual rather than abrupt. In all
cases, assuming independence gave incorrect uncertainty estimates of CTP. For
15 animals, neither model could be fitted because of irregular temperature
profiles that did not conform to the assumption of a single transition.
Arbitrary imposition of broken stick fits on a gradual transition profile and
assuming independent rather than autocorrelated error may result in misleading
estimates of CTP. Identification of the onset of irreversible shock will
require further quantification of appropriate time-dependent physiological
variables and their behaviour during haemorrhage.

of a large number of genes. Typical analyses of such data focus on the
individual genes, but recent work has demonstrated that evaluating changes in
expression across predefined sets of genes often increases statistical power
and produces more robust results. We introduce a new methodology for
identifying gene sets that are differentially expressed under varying
experimental conditions. Our approach uses a hierarchical Bayesian framework
where a hyperparameter measures the significance of each gene set. Using
simulated data, we compare our proposed method to alternative approaches, such
as Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) and Gene Set Analysis (GSA). Our
approach provides the best overall performance. We also discuss the application
of our method to experimental data based on p53 mutation status.

scales of biological organization. Of fundamental interest are the causes of
turbulent periods of conflict. We analyze conflict dynamics in a monkey society
model system. We develop a technique, Inductive Game Theory, to extract
directly from time-series data the decision-making strategies used by
individuals and groups. This technique uses Monte Carlo simulation to test
alternative causal models of conflict dynamics. We find individuals base their
decision to fight on memory of social factors, not on short timescale
ecological resource competition. Furthermore, the social assessments on which
these decisions are based are triadic (self in relation to another pair of
individuals), not pairwise. We show that this triadic decision making causes
long conflict cascades and that there is a high population cost of the large
fights associated with these cascades. These results suggest that individual
agency has been over-emphasized in the social evolution of complex aggregates,
and that pair-wise formalisms are inadequate. An appreciation of the empirical
foundations of the collective dynamics of conflict is a crucial step towards
its effective management.

nitrogen, and phosphorus. The scarcity of any of these elements can severely
restrict organismal and population growth. However, many trophic interaction
models only consider carbon limitation via energy flow. In this paper, we
construct an algal growth model with the explicit incorporation of light and
nutrient availability to characterize both carbon and phosphorus limitations.
We provide a global analysis of this model to illustrate how light and nutrient
availability regulate algal dynamics.

polar oppositions of organism and environment. We argue that a triadic
conceptual structure offers an alternative perspective under which the
information generating role of evolution as a physical process can be analyzed,
and propose a new diagrammatic approach. Peirce's natural philosophy was deeply
influenced by his reception of both Darwin's theory and thermodynamics. Thus,
we elaborate on a new synthesis which puts together his theory of signs and
modern Maximum Entropy approaches to evolution. Following recent contributions
to the naturalization of Peircean semiosis, we show that triadic structures
involve the conjunction of three different kinds of causality, efficient,
formal and final. We apply this on Ulanowicz's analysis of autocatalytic cycles
as primordial patterns of life. This paves the way for a semiotic view of
thermodynamics which is built on the idea that Peircean interpretants are
systems of physical inference devices evolving under natural selection. In this
view, the principles of Maximum Entropy, Maximum Power, and Maximum Entropy
Production work together to drive the emergence of information carrying
structures, which at the same time maximize information capacity as well as the
gradients of energy flows, such that ultimately, contrary to Schroedinger's
seminal contribution, the evolutionary process is seen to be a physical
expression of the Second Law.

stochasticity is studied for a seasonally forced
susceptible-exposed-infective-recovered stochastic model. The model is explored
in the parameter region that corresponds to childhood infectious diseases such
as measles. The power spectrum of the stochastic fluctuations around the
attractors of the deterministic system that describes the model in the
thermodynamic limit is computed analytically and validated by stochastic
simulations for large system sizes. Size effects are studied through additional
simulations. Other effects such as switching between coexisting attractors
induced by stochasticity often mentioned in the literature as playing an
important role in the dynamics of childhood infectious diseases are also
investigated. The main conclusion is that stochastic amplification, rather than
these effects, is the key ingredient to understand the observed incidence
patterns.

glutathione reductase based enzymatic AND logic gates in which the enzymes and
their substrates serve as logic inputs are performed. These two systems are
examples of the novel, previously unexplored, class of biochemical logic gates
that illustrate potential biomedical applications of biochemical logic. They
are characterized by input concentrations at logic 0 and 1 states corresponding
to normal and abnormal physiological conditions. Our analysis shows that the
logic gates under investigation have similar noise characteristics. Both
significantly amplify random noise present in inputs, however we establish that
for realistic widths of the input noise distributions, it is still possible to
differentiate between the logic 0 and 1 states of the output. This indicates
that reliable detection of abnormal biomedical conditions is indeed possible
with such enzyme-logic systems.

eight mutually-exclusive compartments representing the human and vector
dynamics. It also includes a control parameter (adulticide spray) in order to
combat the mosquito. The model presents three possible equilibria: two
disease-free equilibria (DFE) --- where humans, with or without mosquitoes,
live without the disease --- and another endemic equilibrium (EE). In the
literature it has been proved that a DFE is locally asymptotically stable,
whenever a certain epidemiological threshold, known as the basic reproduction
number, is less than one. We show that if a minimum level of insecticide is
applied, then it is possible to maintain the basic reproduction number below
unity. A case study, using data of the outbreak that occured in 2009 in Cape
Verde, is presented.

uncertainties. First approach is noncommittal, making no assumptions about
properties of uncertainty or parameters of stimulation. Then we explain the
relationship between this approach and the one commonly used in modeling
"higher level" aspects of sensory systems, such as in visual cue integration,
where assumptions are made about properties of stimulation. The two approaches
follow similar logic, except in one case maximal uncertainty is minimized, and
in the other minimal certainty is maximized. Then we demonstrate how optimal
solutions are found to the problem of resource allocation under uncertainty.

are calculated for a potential energy function with minimal energetic
frustration. A kinetic transition network is constructed using the discrete
path sampling approach, and the resulting potential energy surface is
visualized by constructing disconnectivity graphs. Owing to topological
constraints, the low-lying portion of the landscape consists of three distinct
regions, corresponding to the native knotted state and to configurations where
either the N- or C-terminus is not yet folded into the knot. The fastest
folding pathways from denatured states exhibit early formation of the
N-terminus portion of the knot and a rate-determining step where the C-terminus
is incorporated. The low-lying minima with the N-terminus knotted and the
C-terminus free therefore constitute an off-pathway intermediate for this
model. The insertion of both the N- and C-termini into the knot occur late in
the folding process, creating large energy barriers that are the rate limiting
steps in the folding process. When compared to other protein folding proteins
of a similar length, this system folds over six orders of magnitude more
slowly.

novelty. We took population genetics models of genes duplicate to study how
evolutionary forces acting during the fixation of mutant allele at duplicate
loci. We study the fixation time of mutant allele at duplicate loci under
double null recessive model (DNR) and haploinsufficient model (HI). And we also
investigate how selection coefficients with other evolutionary force influence
the fixation frequency of mutant allele at duplicate loci. Our results suggest
that the selection plays a role in the evolutionary fate of duplicate genes,
and tight linkage would help the mutant allele preserved at duplicate loci. Our
theoretical simulation agree with the genomics data analysis result well, that
selection, rather than drift, plays a important role in the establishment of
duplicate loci, and recombination have a great opportunity to be acted upon
selection.

vibrations in the Raman spectra is developed. It is based on the valence-optic
theory and the model for description of conformational vibrations of DNA with
counterions. The calculations for Na- and Cs-DNA low-frequency Raman spectra
show that the vibrations of DNA backbone chains near 15 cm-1 have the greatest
intensity. In the spectrum of Na-DNA at frequency range upper than 40 cm-1 the
modes of H-bond stretching in base pairs have the greatest intensities, while
the modes of ion-phosphate vibrations have the lowest intensity. In Cs-DNA
spectra at this frequency range the mode of ion-phosphate vibrations is
prominent. Its intensity is much higher than the intensities of Na-DNA modes of
this spectra range. Other modes of Cs-DNA have much lower intensities than in
the case of Na-DNA. The comparison of our calculations with the experimental
data shows that developed approach gives the understanding of the sensitivity
of DNA low-frequency Raman bands to the neutralization of the double helix by
light and heavy counterions.

besides the classical strategies of cooperation (C) and defection (D), we
consider punishing cooperators (PC) or punishing defectors (PD) as an
additional strategy. Using a minimalist modeling approach, our goal is to
separately clarify and identify the consequences of the two punishing
strategies. Since punishment is costly, punishing strategies loose the
evolutionary competition in case of well-mixed interactions. When spatial
interactions are taken into account, however, the outcome can be strikingly
different, and cooperation may spread. The underlying mechanism depends on the
character of the punishment strategy. In case of cooperating punishers,
increasing the fine results in a rising cooperation level. In contrast, in the
presence of the PD strategy, the phase diagram exhibits a reentrant transition
as the fine is increased. Accordingly, the level of cooperation shows a
non-monotonous dependence on the fine. Remarkably, punishing strategies can
spread in both cases, but based on largely different mechanisms, which depend
on the cooperativeness (or not) of punishers.

by the claim of a terrestrial extinction periodicity, thought to be mediated by
comet showers. The orbit of a distant companion to the Sun is expected to be
perturbed by the Galactic tidal field and encounters with passing stars, which
will induce variation in the period. We examine the evidence for the previously
proposed periodicity, using two modern, greatly improved paleontological
datasets of fossil biodiversity. We find that there is a narrow peak at 27 My
in the cross-spectrum of extinction intensity time series between these
independent datasets. This periodicity extends over a time period nearly twice
that for which it was originally noted. An excess of extinction events are
associated with this periodicity at 99% confidence. In this sense we confirm
the originally noted feature in the time series for extinction. However, we
find that it displays extremely regular timing for about 0.5 Gy. The regularity
of the timing compared with earlier calculations of orbital perturbation would
seem to exclude the Nemesis hypothesis as a causal factor.

  Penalty</title><categories>stat.ML q-bio.MN</categories><comments>12 pages, 4 figures, 1 table</comments><license>http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/</license><abstract>  Components of biological systems interact with each other in order to carry
out vital cell functions. Such information can be used to improve estimation
and inference, and to obtain better insights into the underlying cellular
mechanisms. Discovering regulatory interactions among genes is therefore an
important problem in systems biology. Whole-genome expression data over time
provides an opportunity to determine how the expression levels of genes are
affected by changes in transcription levels of other genes, and can therefore
be used to discover regulatory interactions among genes.
  In this paper, we propose a novel penalization method, called truncating
lasso, for estimation of causal relationships from time-course gene expression
data. The proposed penalty can correctly determine the order of the underlying
time series, and improves the performance of the lasso-type estimators.
Moreover, the resulting estimate provides information on the time lag between
activation of transcription factors and their effects on regulated genes. We
provide an efficient algorithm for estimation of model parameters, and show
that the proposed method can consistently discover causal relationships in the
large $p$, small $n$ setting. The performance of the proposed model is
evaluated favorably in simulated, as well as real, data examples. The proposed
truncating lasso method is implemented in the R-package grangerTlasso and is
available at http://www.stat.lsa.umich.edu/~shojaie.

for a single resource during each of these periods according to one of the
following competition types: scramble, contest, or an intermediate between the
two. The effect of two successive competition periods is determined to be
expressed by simple relations on products of two "transition matrices" for
various sets of competition types for the two periods. In particular, for the
scramble and contest competition combination, results vary widely depending on
the order of the two competition types. Furthermore, the stability properties
of derived population models as well as the effect of more than two successive
competition periods are discussed.

approximations of the microscopic updating stochastic processes. This
generalizes the known mean-field ordinary differential equations and provide a
powerful tool to investigate the spatial effects in populations evolution. The
deterministic equations allow to identify many interesting features of the
evolution of strategy profiles in a population, such as standing and traveling
waves, and pattern formation, especially in replicator-type evolutions.

major role in the nervous system. Earlier electrophysiological studies have
made use of piecewise linear characterization of voltage clamped neurons, which
consists of a sequence of linear admittances computed at different voltage
levels. In this paper, the linear approach is extended to a piecewise quadratic
characterization in two different ways. First, an analytical model is derived
with power series following the work pionneered by Fitzhugh. Second, matrix
calculus is developed to provide a novel quantitative analysis not dependent on
differential equations. This method provides an assessment of quadratic
responses for both data recorded from individual neurons and their
corresponding models.

important biological insights, such as the presence of hubs and hierarchical
modularity. There is also a growing interest in studying the statistical
properties of networks in the context of cancer genomics. However, relatively
little is known as to what network features differ between the cancer and
normal cell physiologies, or between different cancer cell phenotypes. Based on
the observation that frequent genomic alterations underlie a more aggressive
cancer phenotype, we asked if such an effect could be detectable as an increase
in the randomness of local gene expression patterns. Using a breast cancer gene
expression data set and a model network of protein interactions we derive
constrained weighted networks defined by a stochastic information flux matrix
reflecting expression correlations between interacting proteins. Based on this
stochastic matrix we propose and compute an entropy measure that quantifies the
degree of randomness in the local pattern of information flux around single
genes. By comparing the local entropies in the non-metastatic versus metastatic
breast cancer networks, we here show that breast cancers that metastasize are
characterised by a small yet significant increase in the degree of randomness
of local expression patterns. We validate this result in three additional
breast cancer expression data sets and demonstrate that local entropy better
characterises the metastatic phenotype than other non-entropy based measures.
We show that increases in entropy can be used to identify genes and signalling
pathways implicated in breast cancer metastasis. Further exploration of such
integrated cancer expression and protein interaction networks will therefore be
a fruitful endeavour.

individuals infect more than the average number of secondary cases. Several
super-spreading individuals have been identified for the 2003 outbreak of
severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). We develop a model for
super-spreading events of infectious diseases, which is based on the outbreak
of SARS. Using this model we describe two methods for estimating the parameters
of the model, which we demonstrate with the small-scale SARS outbreak at the
Amoy Gardens, Hong Kong, and the large-scale outbreak in the entire Hong Kong
Special Administrative Region. One method is based on parameters calculated for
the classical susceptible - infected - removed (SIR) disease model. The second
is based on parameter estimates found in the literature. Using the parameters
calculated for the SIR model, our model predicts an outcome similar to that for
the SIR model. On the other hand, using parameter estimates from SARS
literature our model predicts a much more serious epidemic.

statistical interactions among the metabolite activities using the ARACNE
reverse-engineering algorithm and on constraining possible metabolic
transformations to satisfy the conservation of mass. The resulting algorithms
are validated on synthetic data from an abridged computational model of
Escherichia coli metabolism. Precision rates upwards of 50% are routinely
observed for identification of full metabolic reactions, and recalls upwards of
20% are also seen.

the decision making of adherent cells. Here we use a mechano-chemical model to
predict the cellular response to varying substrate stiffness. The model
equations combine the mechanics of contractile actin filament bundles with a
model for the Rho-signaling pathway triggered by forces at cell-matrix
contacts. A bifurcation analysis of cellular contractility as a function of
substrate stiffness reveals a bistable response, thus defining a lower
threshold of stiffness, below which cells are not able to build up contractile
forces, and an upper threshold of stiffness, above which cells are always in a
strongly contracted state. Using the full dynamical model, we predict that
rate-dependent hysteresis will occur in the cellular traction forces when cells
are exposed to substrates of time-dependent stiffness.

continuous time consensus protocols (CPs) is presented in this work. Our method
applies to networks with directed information flow; both cooperative and
noncooperative interactions; networks under weak stochastic forcing; and those
whose topology and strength of connections may vary in time. The graph
theoretic interpretation of the analytical results is emphasized. We show how
the spectral properties, such as algebraic connectivity and total effective
resistance, as well as the geometric properties, such the dimension and the
structure of the cycle subspace of the underlying graph, shape stability of the
corresponding CPs. In addition, we explore certain implications of the spectral
graph theory to CP design. In particular, we point out that expanders, sparse
highly connected graphs, generate CPs whose performance remains uniformly high
when the size of the network grows unboundedly. Similarly, we highlight the
benefits of using random versus regular network topologies for CP design. We
illustrate these observations with numerical examples and refer to the relevant
graph-theoretic results.

describe individual proteins as rule-based computing machines. The MFA
formalism provides a framework for modeling individual protein behaviors and
systems-level dynamics via construction of programmable and executable
machines. Models specified within this formalism explicitly represent the
context-sensitive dynamics of individual proteins driven by external inputs and
represent protein-protein interactions as synchronized machine
reconfigurations. Both deterministic and stochastic simulations can be applied
to quantitatively compute the dynamics of MFA models. We apply the MFA
formalism to model and simulate a simple example of a signal transduction
system that involves a MAP kinase cascade and a scaffold protein.

  mediated through natural selection and ecological feedbacks</title><categories>q-bio.PE</categories><comments>18 pages, 4 figures</comments><license>http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/</license><abstract>  Males are often the "sicker" sex with male biased parasitism found in a
taxonomically diverse range of species. There is considerable interest in the
processes that could underlie the evolution of sex-biased parasitism. Mating
system differences along with differences in lifespan may play a key role. We
examine whether these factors are likely to lead to male-biased parasitism
through natural selection taking into account the critical role that ecological
feedbacks play in the evolution of defence. We use a host-parasite model with
two-sexes and the techniques of adaptive dynamics to investigate how mating
system and sexual differences in competitive ability and longevity can select
for a bias in the rates of parasitism. Male-biased parasitism is selected for
when males have a shorter average lifespan or when males are subject to greater
competition for resources. Male-biased parasitism evolves as a consequence of
sexual differences in life history that produce a greater proportion of
susceptible females than males and therefore reduce the cost of avoiding
parasitism in males. Different mating systems such as monogamy, polygamy or
polyandry did not produce a bias in parasitism through these ecological
feedbacks but may accentuate an existing bias.

probabilities and at least one absorbing boundary. In evolution, this describes
selection acting on two different types in a finite population where
reproductive events occur successively. If the two types have equal fitness the
system performs a random walk. If one type has a fitness advantage it is
favored by selection, which introduces a bias (asymmetry) in the transition
probabilities. How long does it take until advantageous mutants have invaded
and taken over? Surprisingly, we find that the average time of such a process
can increase, even if the mutant type always has a fitness advantage. We
discuss this finding for the Moran process and develop a simplified model which
allows a more intuitive understanding. We show that this effect can occur for
weak but non--vanishing bias (selection) in the state dependent transition
rates and infer the scaling with system size. We also address the Wright-Fisher
model commonly used in population genetics, which shows that this stochastic
slowdown is not restricted to birth-death processes.

supplies is a matter of public health concern. Currently, the National
Antimicrobial Resistance Monitoring Systems, a collaborative effort of the
Centers for Disease Control, the US Department of Agriculture, and the US Food
and Drug Administration, does not monitor antimicrobial resistance in surface
waters. Given the serious nature of antibiotic resistance in clinical settings,
and the likelihood that antibiotic resistant bacteria can be transmitted to
humans from large environmental reservoirs via drinking water, explanations for
the distribution of antibiotic resistant bacteria and tools for studying this
distribution must be found. Here we focus on mathematical modeling of
cultivable bacteria in a river, which will be used to study the distribution of
antibiotic resistant bacteria in the environment. We consider both antibiotic
resistant and non-antibiotic resistant bacteria in the model, and, taking into
account the strong correlation between land use and antibiotic resistant
bacteria in rivers, we include a function for the influx of bacteria into the
river from the shore. We simulate the model for two different time scales and
show that if there is too many bacteria from the land entering the river, the
river entirely fills with antibiotic resistant bacteria, while less frequent
influxes allows time for the bacteria to lose the antibiotic resistant gene.
This mathematically verifies that reduction in antibiotic use near the banks of
rivers, will reduce the counts of antibiotic resistant bacteria in rivers.

orientation preference columns. In some species including humans, orientation
columns are radially arranged around singular points like the spokes of a
wheel, that are called pinwheels. The pinwheel structure has been observed
first with optical imaging techniques and more recently by in vivo two-photon
imaging proving their organization with single cell precision. In this research
we provide evidence that pinwheels are de facto optimal distributions for
coding at the best angular position and momentum. In the last years many
authors have recognized that the functional architecture of V1 is locally
invariant with respect to the symmetry group of rotations and translations
SE(2). In the present study we show that the orientation cortical maps used to
construct pinwheels can be modeled as coherent states, i.e. the configurations
best localized both in angular position and angular momentum. The theory we
adopt is based on the well known uncertainty principle, introduced by
Heisenberg in quantum mechanics and later extended to many other groups of
invariance. Here we state a corresponding principle in the cortical geometry
with SE(2) symmetry, and by computing its minimizers we obtain a model of
orientation activity maps in the cortex. As it is well known the pinwheels
configuration is directly constructed from these activity maps, and we will be
able to formally reproduce their structure starting from the group symmetries
of the functional architecture of the visual cortex. The primary visual cortex
is then modeled as an integrated system in which the set of simple cells
implements the SE(2) group, the horizontal connectivity implements its Lie
algebra and the pinwheels implement its minimal uncertainty states.

from sociological or biological data for instance, has become a major field of
interest in the last decade. One way to deal with it is to consider that
networks are built from small functional units called motifs, which can be
found by looking for small subgraphs whose numbers of occurrences in the whole
network are surprisingly high. In this article, we propose to define motifs
through a local overrepresentation in the network and develop a statistic to
detect them without relying on simulations. We then illustrate the performance
of our procedure on simulated and real data, recovering already known
biologically relevant motifs. Moreover, we explain how our method gives some
information about the respective roles of the vertices in a motif.

factors governing the advance of an invasive species. We model biological
invasion as an individual-based, stochastic process on a two-dimensional
landscape. An ecologically superior invader and a resident species compete for
space preemptively. Our general model includes the basic contact process and a
variant of the Eden model as special cases. We employ the concept of a
"roughened" front to quantify effects of discreteness and stochasticity on
invasion; we emphasize the probability distribution of the front-runner's
relative position. That is, we analyze the location of the most advanced
invader as the extreme deviation about the front's mean position. We find that
a class of models with different assumptions about neighborhood interactions
exhibit universal characteristics. That is, key features of the invasion
dynamics span a class of models, independently of locally detailed demographic
rules. Our results integrate theories of invasive spatial growth and generate
novel hypotheses linking habitat or landscape size (length of the invading
front) to invasion velocity, and to the relative position of the most advanced
invader.

high-resolution spatial information. Integration of information from scanning
fluorescence X-ray microscopy with information from atomic force microscopy was
used to generate a magnesium concentration map and to determine the X-ray
linear absorption coefficient map within a whole dehydrated mammary epithelial
cell.

and DNA, is limited because the approximations we usually apply to model inert
materials are not in general applicable to soft, chemically inhomogeneous
systems. The configurational complexity of biomolecules means the entropic
contribution to the free energy is a significant factor in their behaviour,
requiring detailed dynamical calculations to fully evaluate. Computer
simulations capable of taking all interatomic interactions into account are
therefore vital. However, even with the best current supercomputing facilities,
we are unable to capture enough of the most interesting aspects of their
behaviour to properly understand how they work. This limits our ability to
design new molecules, to treat diseases, for example. Progress in biomolecular
simulation depends crucially on increasing the computing power available.
Faster classical computers are in the pipeline, but these provide only
incremental improvements. Quantum computing offers the possibility of
performing huge numbers of calculations in parallel, when it becomes available.
We discuss the current open questions in biomolecular simulation, how these
might be addressed using quantum computation and speculate on the future
importance of quantum-assisted biomolecular modelling.

in protein levels across a population of cells. To explain this variability,
different sources of mRNA fluctuations ('Poisson' and 'Telegraph' processes)
have been proposed in stochastic models of gene expression. Both Poisson and
Telegraph scenario models explain experimental observations of noise in protein
levels in terms of 'bursts' of protein expression. Correspondingly, there is
considerable interest in establishing relations between burst and steady-state
protein distributions for general stochastic models of gene expression. In this
work, we address this issue by considering a mapping between stochastic models
of gene expression and problems of interest in queueing theory. By applying a
general theorem from queueing theory, Little's Law, we derive exact relations
which connect burst and steady-state distribution means for models with
arbitrary waiting-time distributions for arrival and degradation of mRNAs and
proteins. The derived relations have implications for approaches to quantify
the degree of transcriptional bursting and hence to discriminate between
different sources of intrinsic noise in gene expression. To illustrate this, we
consider a model for regulation of protein expression bursts by small RNAs. For
a broad range of parameters, we derive analytical expressions (validated by
stochastic simulations) for the mean protein levels as the levels of regulatory
small RNAs are varied. The results obtained show that the degree of
transcriptional bursting can, in principle, be determined from changes in mean
steady-state protein levels for general stochastic models of gene expression.

generation of phenotypic heterogeneity in the isogenic microbial population
enabling a subset of the population to survive under stress. In a recent study,
a mycobacterial population of M. smegmatis was shown to develop phenotypic
heterogeneity under nutrient depletion. The observed heterogeneity is in the
form of a bimodal distribution of the expression levels of the Green
Fluorescent Protein (GFP) as reporter with the gfp fused to the promoter of the
rel gene. The stringent response pathway is initiated in the subpopulation with
high rel activity.In the present study, we characterize quantitatively the
single cell promoter activity of the three key genes, namely, mprA, sigE and
rel, in the stringent response pathway with gfp as the reporter. The origin of
bimodality in the GFP distribution lies in two stable expression states, i.e.,
bistability. We develop a theoretical model to study the dynamics of the
stringent response pathway. The model incorporates a recently proposed
mechanism of bistability based on positive feedback and cell growth retardation
due to protein synthesis. Based on flow cytometry data, we establish that the
distribution of GFP levels in the mycobacterial population at any point of time
is a linear superposition of two invariant distributions, one Gaussian and the
other lognormal, with only the coefficients in the linear combination depending
on time. This allows us to use a binning algorithm and determine the time
variation of the mean protein level, the fraction of cells in a subpopulation
and also the coefficient of variation, a measure of gene expression noise.The
results of the theoretical model along with a comprehensive analysis of the
flow cytometry data provide definitive evidence for the coexistence of two
subpopulations with overlapping protein distributions.

olfactory information is represented by a spatially and temporally sparse code.
Each odor stimulus will activate only a small portion of neurons and each
stimulus leads to only a short phasic response following stimulus onset
irrespective of the actual duration of a constant stimulus. The mechanisms
responsible for the sparse code in the KCs are yet unresolved.
  Here, we explore the role of the neuron-intrinsic mechanism of
spike-frequency adaptation (SFA) in producing temporally sparse responses to
sensory stimulation in higher processing stages. Our single neuron model is
defined through a conductance-based integrate-and-fire neuron with
spike-frequency adaptation [1]. We study a fully connected feed-forward network
architecture in coarse analogy to the insect olfactory pathway. A first layer
of ten neurons represents the projection neurons (PNs) of the antenna lobe. All
PNs receive a step-like input from the olfactory receptor neurons, which was
realized by independent Poisson processes. The second layer represents 100 KCs
which converge onto ten neurons in the output layer which represents the
population of mushroom body extrinsic neurons (ENs).
  Our simulation result matches with the experimental observations. In
particular, intracellular recordings of PNs show a clear phasic-tonic response
that outlasts the stimulus [2] while extracellular recordings from KCs in the
locust express sharp transient responses [3]. We conclude that the
neuron-intrinsic mechanism is can explain a progressive temporal response
sparsening in the insect olfactory system. Further experimental work is needed
to test this hypothesis empirically.

of predictability, going in crescendo from simple linear systems to
high-dimensional nonlinear systems with stochastic forcing, which exhibit
emergent properties such as phase transitions and regime shifts. Then, a
detailed correspondence between the phenomenology of earthquakes, financial
crashes and epileptic seizures is offered. The presented statistical evidence
provides the substance of a general phase diagram for understanding the many
facets of the spatio-temporal organization of these systems. A key insight is
to organize the evidence and mechanisms in terms of two summarizing measures:
(i) amplitude of disorder or heterogeneity in the system and (ii) level of
coupling or interaction strength among the system's components. On the basis of
the recently identified remarkable correspondence between earthquakes and
seizures, we present detailed information on a class of stochastic point
processes that has been found to be particularly powerful in describing
earthquake phenomenology and which, we think, has a promising future in
epileptology. The so-called self-exciting Hawkes point processes capture
parsimoniously the idea that events can trigger other events, and their
cascades of interactions and mutual influence are essential to understand the
behavior of these systems.

visual area V1 in the human neocortex that has been designed to account for the
experimentally observed orientation tuning curves by local, i.e.,
cortico-cortical computations. The tuning curves are stationary, i.e. time
independent, solutions of this dynamical model. One important assumption
underlying the Ring Model is that the LGN input to V1 is weakly tuned to the
retinal orientation and that it is the local computations in V1 that sharpen
this tuning. Because the equations that describe the Ring Model have built-in
equivariance properties in the synaptic weight distribution with respect to a
particular group acting on the retinal orientation of the stimulus, the model
in effect encodes an infinite number of tuning curves that are arbitrarily
translated with respect to each other. By using the Orbit Space Reduction
technique we rewrite the model equations in canonical form as functions of
polynomials that are invariant with respect to the action of this group. This
allows us to combine equivariant bifurcation theory with an efficient numerical
continuation method in order to compute the tuning curves predicted by the Ring
Model. Surprisingly some of these tuning curves are not tuned to the stimulus.
We interpret them as neural illusions and show numerically how they can be
induced by simple dynamical stimuli. These neural illusions are important
biological predictions of the model. If they could be observed experimentally
this would be a strong point in favour of the Ring Model. We also show how our
theoretical analysis allows to very simply specify the ranges of the model
parameters by comparing the model predictions with published experimental
observations.

variety of knots and catenanes. Twist knots are some of the most common
conformations of these products and they can act as substrates for further
rounds of site-specific recombination. They are also one of the simplest
families of knots and catenanes. Yet, our systematic understanding of their
implication in DNA and important cellular processes like site-specific
recombination is very limited. Here we present a topological model of
site-specific recombination characterising all possible products of this
reaction on twist knot substrates, extending previous work of Buck and Flapan.
We illustrate how to use our model to examine previously uncharacterised
experimental data. We also show how our model can help determine the sequence
of products in multiple rounds of processive recombination and distinguish
between products of processive and distributive recombination. This model
studies generic site- specific recombination on arbitrary twist knot
substrates, a subject for which there is limited global understanding. We also
provide a systematic method of applying our model to a variety of different
recombination systems.

exploited in systems biology in order to suitably model the differentiating
processes arising in living cells. In order to describe genetic regulatory
networks several deterministic models based on systems of nonlinear ordinary
differential equations have been proposed. Few studies have been developed to
characterize how either an external input or the coupling can drive systems
with different coexisting states. For the sake of simplicity, in this
manuscript we focus on systems belonging to the class of radial isochron clocks
that exhibits hard excitation, in order to investigate their complex dynamics,
local and global bifurcations arising in presence of constant external inputs.
In particular the occurrence of saddle node on limit cycle bifurcations is
detected.

processes, including cell migration, proliferation, and apoptosis. Ligand
binding activates integrins by stabilizing an integrin conformation with
separated cytoplasmic tails, thus enabling the binding of proteins that mediate
cytoplasmic signaling. Experiments demonstrate a high sensitivity of integrin
signaling to ligand density and this has been accounted mainly to avidity
effects. Based on experimental data we have developed a quantitative Monte
Carlo model for integrin signal initiation. We show that within the
physiological ligand density range avidity effects cannot explain the
sensitivity of cellular signaling to small changes in ligand density. Src
kinases are among the first proteins to be activated, possibly by trans
auto-phosphorylation. We calculate the extent of integrin and ligand clustering
as well as the speed and extent of Src kinase activation by trans
auto-phosphorylation or direct binding at different experimentally monitored
ligand densities. We find that the experimentally observed ligand density
dependency can be reproduced if Src kinases are activated by trans
auto-phosphorylation or some other mechanism limits integrin-dependent Src
kinase activation. We propose that Src kinase and thus cell activation by trans
auto-phosphorylation may provide a mechanism to enable ligand-density dependent
responses at physiological ligand densities. The capacity to detect small
differences in ligand density at a ligand density that is large enough to
permit cell adhesion is likely to be important for haptotaxis.

complexes while minimizing promiscuous non-functional interactions? Here we
study this problem using a first-principle model of the cell whose phenotypic
traits are directly determined from its genome through biophysical properties
of protein structures and binding interactions in crowded cellular environment.
The model cell includes three independent prototypical pathways, whose
topologies of Protein-Protein Interaction (PPI) sub-networks are different, but
whose contributions to the cell fitness are equal. Model cells evolve through
genotypic mutations and phenotypic protein copy number variations. We found a
strong relationship between evolved physical-chemical properties of protein
interactions and their abundances due to a "frustration" effect: strengthening
of functional interactions brings about hydrophobic interfaces, which make
proteins prone to promiscuous binding. The balancing act is achieved by
lowering concentrations of hub proteins while raising solubilities and
abundances of functional monomers. Based on these principles we generated and
analyzed a possible realization of the proteome-wide PPI network in yeast. In
this simulation we found that high-throughput affinity capture - mass
spectroscopy experiments can detect functional interactions with high fidelity
only for high abundance proteins while missing most interactions for low
abundance proteins.

the myeloid lineage and uncontrolled proliferation of a progenitor state. Using
phorbol myristate acetate (PMA), it is possible to overcome this block in THP-1
cells (an M5-AML containing the MLL-MLLT3 fusion), resulting in differentiation
to an adherent monocytic phenotype. As part of FANTOM4, we used microarrays to
identify 23 microRNAs that are regulated by PMA. We identify four PMA-induced
micro- RNAs (mir-155, mir-222, mir-424 and mir-503) that when overexpressed
cause cell-cycle arrest and partial differentiation and when used in
combination induce additional changes not seen by any individual microRNA. We
further characterize these prodifferentiative microRNAs and show that mir-155
and mir-222 induce G2 arrest and apoptosis, respectively. We find mir-424 and
mir-503 are derived from a polycistronic precursor mir-424-503 that is under
repression by the MLL-MLLT3 leukemogenic fusion. Both of these microRNAs
directly target cell-cycle regulators and induce G1 cell-cycle arrest when
overexpressed in THP-1. We also find that the pro-differentiative mir-424 and
mir-503 downregulate the anti-differentiative mir-9 by targeting a site in its
primary transcript. Our study highlights the combinatorial effects of multiple
microRNAs within cellular systems.

high-density multi-electrode arrays (MEAs). Our method can distinguish large
numbers of distinct neural units, even when spikes overlap, and accounts for
intrinsic variability of spikes from each unit. As MEAs grow larger, it is
important to find spike-identification methods that are scalable, that is, the
computational cost of spike fitting should scale well with the number of units
observed. Our algorithm accomplishes this goal, and is fast, because it
exploits the spatial locality of each unit and the basic biophysics of
extracellular signal propagation. Human intervention is minimized and
streamlined via a graphical interface. We illustrate our method on data from a
mammalian retina preparation and document its performance on simulated data
consisting of spikes added to experimentally measured background noise. The
algorithm is highly accurate.

synthesis of pectate lyases (Pels), the major virulence factors in Dickeya
dadantii. This work focuses on the simultaneous modeling of the metabolic
degradation of pectin by Pel enzymes and the genetic regulation of pel genes by
2-keto-3-deoxygluconate (KDG), a catabolite product of pectin which inactivates
KdgR, one of the main repressors of pel genes. This modeling scheme takes into
account the fact that the system is composed of two time-varying compartments:
the extracellular medium, where Pel enzymes cleave pectin into oligomers, and
the bacterial cytoplasm where, after internalization, oligomers are converted
to KDG. Using the quasi-stationary state approximations, the model consists of
some nonlinear differential equations for which most of the parameters could be
estimated from the literature or from independent experiments. The few
remaining unknown parameters were obtained by fitting the model equations
against a set of Pel activity data. Model predictions were verified by
measuring the time courses of bacterial growth, Pel production, pel mRNA
accumulation and pectin consumption under various growth conditions. This work
reveals that pectin is almost totally consumed before the burst of Pel
production. This paradoxical behaviour can be interpreted as an evolutionary
strategy to control the diffusion process so that as soon as a small amount of
pectin is detected by the bacteria in its surroundings it anticipates more
pectin to come. The model also predicts the possibility of bistable steady
states in the presence of constant pectin compounds.

distinguish probe fluorescence from autofluorescent backgrounds in turbid
media. MagMOONs are micro/nano-sized particles with magnetically controlled
orientation and orientation-dependent fluorescence. These probes blink when
they rotate in response to rotating external magnetic fields. This blinking
signal can be separated from backgrounds enabling spectrochemical sensing in
media with strong autofluorescence. We explore the effect of scattering on
MagMOON fluorescence. Turbid media reduce the modulated MagMOON signal due to a
combination of attenuation of fluorescence signal and reduction in contrast
between "On" and "Off" states. The blinking MagMOON fluorescence spectrum can
be detected in turbid non-dairy creamer solution with extinction 2.0, and
through 9 mm of chicken breast tissue, suggesting that whole mouse imaging is
feasible by using this strategy.

conditions explicitly and further prove that they are satisfied by our
coarse-grained network construction within the annealed network approximation.
Finally, we numerically show that the phase transitions and fluctuations on the
coarse-grained network are all in good agreements with those on the original
one.

properties for a wide range of scales, from cellular to ecological levels,
suggesting the existence of a common evolutionary origin. A general
evolutionary mechanism based on global stability has been proposed recently [J
I Perotti, O V Billoni, F A Tamarit, D R Chialvo, S A Cannas, Phys. Rev. Lett.
103, 108701 (2009)]. This mechanism is incorporated into a model of a growing
network of interacting agents in which each new agent's membership in the
network is determined by the agent's effect on the network's global stability.
We show that, out of this stability constraint, several topological properties
observed in biological networks emerge in a self organized manner. The
influence of the stability selection mechanism on the dynamics associated to
the resulting network is analyzed as well.

dissimilar viruses that infection with one cannot confer cross-immunity to the
other. However, our examination of the records of the past 25 influenza seasons
in the U.S. reveals that almost every time there is an early and severe
influenza A outbreak, the annual influenza B epidemic is almost entirely
suppressed (and is never suppressed otherwise). Temporary broad-spectrum (aka
"heterologous") immunity in the aftermath of influenza infection is the most
direct explanation for this phenomenon. We find a remarkably weak degree of
temporary cross-immunity is needed to explain these patterns, and that indeed
influenza B provides an ideal setting for the observation of heterologous
immune effects outside of the carefully controlled environment of a laboratory.

Rev. Biophys. (2010) 39:159-183</journal-ref><license>http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/</license><abstract>  Understanding how monomeric proteins fold under in vitro conditions is
crucial to describing their functions in the cellular context. Significant
advances both in theory and experiments have resulted in a conceptual framework
for describing the folding mechanisms of globular proteins. The experimental
data and theoretical methods have revealed the multifaceted character of
proteins. Proteins exhibit universal features that can be determined using only
the number of amino acid residues (N) and polymer concepts. The sizes of
proteins in the denatured and folded states, cooperativity of the folding
transition, dispersions in the melting temperatures at the residue level, and
time scales of folding are to a large extent determined by N. The consequences
of finite N especially on how individual residues order upon folding depends on
the topology of the folded states. Such intricate details can be predicted
using the Molecular Transfer Model that combines simulations with measured
transfer free energies of protein building blocks from water to the desired
concentration of the denaturant. By watching one molecule fold at a time, using
single molecule methods, the validity of the theoretically anticipated
heterogeneity in the folding routes, and the N-dependent time scales for the
three stages in the approach to the native state have been established. Despite
the successes of theory, of which only a few examples are documented here, we
conclude that much remains to be done to solve the "protein folding problem" in
the broadest sense.

exemplified by the stochastic SIRS model. The birth-death master equation of
the model is simulated using exact numerics and analysed within the linear
noise approximation. The endemic fixed point is unstable to internal
demographic noise, and leads to sustained oscillations. This is ensured when
the eigenvalues ($\lambda$) of the linearised drift matrix are complex, which
in turn, is possible only if detailed balance is violated. In the oscillatory
state, the phases decorrelate asymptotically, distinguishing such oscillations
from those produced by external periodic forcing. These so-called quasicycles
are of sufficient strength to be detected reliably only when the ratio
$|Im(\lambda)/Re(\lambda)|$ is of order unity. The coherence or regularity of
these oscillations show a maximum as a function of population size, an effect
known variously as stochastic coherence or coherence resonance. We find that
stochastic coherence can be simply understood as resulting from a non-monotonic
variation of $|Im(\lambda)/Re(\lambda)|$ with population size. Thus, within the
linear noise approximation, stochastic coherence can be predicted from a purely
deterministic analysis. The non-normality of the linearised drift matrix,
associated with the violation of detailed balance, leads to enhanced
fluctuations in the population amplitudes.

long-term memory can -- as a gradual modification of synaptic weights -- since
it takes place too quickly. Theories based on some form of cellular
bistability, however, do not seem able to account for the fact that noisy
neurons can collectively store information in a robust manner. We show how a
sufficiently clustered network of simple model neurons can be instantly induced
into metastable states capable of retaining information for a short time (a few
seconds). The mechanism is robust to different network topologies and kinds of
neural model. This could constitute a viable means available to the brain for
sensory and/or short-term memory with no need of synaptic learning. Relevant
phenomena described by neurobiology and psychology, such as local
synchronization of synaptic inputs and power-law statistics of forgetting
avalanches, emerge naturally from this mechanism, and we suggest possible
experiments to test its viability in more biological settings.

can be vital for showing properties about the underlying systems. For example
in biological systems, bistability of a chemical reaction network can hint at
its function as a biological switch. Unfortunately, the state space of these
systems is infinite in most cases, preventing the use of traditional steady
state solution techniques. In this paper we develop a new approach to tackle
this problem by first retrieving geometric bounds enclosing a major part of the
steady state probability mass, followed by a more detailed analysis revealing
state-wise bounds.

simple interactions. In particular we show the importance of the `search time'
- the time a returning forager takes to find an available nectar receiver - in
restricting the forager population to a level consistent with colony-wide
needs.

Purifying selection dominates in large panmictic populations, where Mendelian
law of independent gene assortment is valid. If the populations are small,
recombination processes are not effective enough to ensure an independent
assortment of linked genes and larger clusters of genes could be inherited as
the genetic units. There are whole clusters of genes which tend to complement
in such conditions instead of single pairs of alleles like in the case of
purifying selection. Computer simulations have shown that switching in-between
complementation and purification strategies has a character of a phase
transition. This is also responsible for specific distribution of recombination
events observed along eukaryotic chromosomes - higher recombination rate is
observed in subtelomeric regions than in central parts of chromosomes - for
sympatric speciation and probably for non-monotonous relation between
reproduction potential and genetic distance between parents.

comprising most of the living protoplasm. While current methods enable in-depth
study of a small number of communities, a simple tool for breadth studies of
bacterial population composition in a large number of samples is lacking. We
propose a novel approach for reconstruction of the composition of an unknown
mixture of bacteria using a single Sanger-sequencing reaction of the mixture.
This method is based on compressive sensing theory, which deals with
reconstruction of a sparse signal using a small number of measurements.
Utilizing the fact that in many cases each bacterial community is comprised of
a small subset of the known bacterial species, we show the feasibility of this
approach for determining the composition of a bacterial mixture. Using
simulations, we show that sequencing a few hundred base-pairs of the 16S rRNA
gene sequence may provide enough information for reconstruction of mixtures
containing tens of species, out of tens of thousands, even in the presence of
realistic measurement noise. Finally, we show initial promising results when
applying our method for the reconstruction of a toy experimental mixture with
five species. Our approach may have a potential for a practical and efficient
way for identifying bacterial species compositions in biological samples.

replication. We previously reported a setup using genes coding for fluorescent
proteins of two colors that allowed us, using a simple model, to extract the
plasmid copy number noise in a monoclonal population of bacteria [J. Wong Ng et
al., Phys. Rev. E, 81, 011909 (2010)]. Here we present a detailed calculation
relating this noise to the measured levels of fluorescence, taking into account
all sources of fluorescence fluctuations: the fluctuation of gene expression as
in the simple model, but also the growth and division of bacteria, the
non-uniform distribution of their ages, the random partition of proteins at
divisions and the replication and partition of plasmids and chromosome. We show
how using the chromosome as a reference helps extracting the plasmid copy
number noise in a self-consistent manner.

the regularization of the population activity and an enhanced post-synaptic

expression of the protein neuroglobin protects neurons in vitro, in animal
models, and in humans, against cell death associated with hypoxic and amyloid
insult. However, until now, the exact mechanism of neuroglobin's protective
action has not been determined. Using cell biology and biochemical approaches
we demonstrate that neuroglobin inhibits the intrinsic pathway of apoptosis in
vitro and intervenes in activation of pro-caspase 9 by interaction with
cytochrome c. Using systems level information of the apoptotic signalling
reactions we have developed a quantitative model of neuroglobin inhibition of
apoptosis, which simulates neuroglobin blocking of apoptosome formation at a
single cell level. Furthermore, this model allows us to explore the effect of
neuroglobin in conditions not easily accessible to experimental study. We found
that the protection of neurons by neuroglobin is very concentration sensitive.
The impact of neuroglobin may arise from both its binding to cytochrome c and
its subsequent redox reaction, although the binding alone is sufficient to
block pro-caspase 9 activation. These data provides an explanation the action
of neuroglobin in the protection of nerve cells from unwanted apoptosis.

They target
anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 proteins, up-regulation of which has been implicated in
the resistance of many cancer cells, particularly leukemia and lymphoma cells,
to apoptosis. Using probabilistic computational modeling of the mitochondrial
pathway of apoptosis, verified by single-cell experimental observations, we
develop a model of Bcl-2 inhibition of apoptosis. Our results clarify how Bcl-2
imparts its anti-apoptotic role by increasing the time-to-death and
cell-to-cell variability. We also show that although the commitment to death is
highly impacted by differences in protein levels at the time of stimulation,
inherent stochastic fluctuations in apoptotic signaling are sufficient to
induce cell-to-cell variability and to allow single cells to escape death. This
study suggests that intrinsic cell-to-cell stochastic variability in apoptotic
signaling is sufficient to cause fractional killing of cancer cells after
exposure to BH3 mimetics. This is an unanticipated facet of cancer
chemoresistance.

strategies and update rules are subjected to evolutionary pressure.
Interactions among agents are specified by complex topologies, and we consider
both homogeneous and heterogeneous situations. We consider deterministic and
stochastic update rules for the strategies, which in turn may consider single
links or full context when selecting agents to copy from. Our results indicate
that the co-evolutionary process preserves heterogeneous networks as a suitable
framework for the emergence of cooperation. Furthermore, on those networks, the
update rule leading to a larger fraction, which we call replicator dynamics, is
selected during co-evolution. On homogeneous networks we observe that even if
replicator dynamics turns out again to be the selected update rule, the
cooperation level is larger than on a fixed update rule framework. We conclude
that for a variety of topologies, the fact that the dynamics coevolves with the
strategies leads in general to more cooperation in the weak Prisoner's Dilemma
game.

ever-increasing amount of digital traces that we leave behind in our daily
activities are changing the way we can approach the study of human and social
interactions. Large-scale datasets, however, are mostly available for
collective and statistical behaviors, at coarse granularities, while
high-resolution data on person-to-person interactions are generally limited to
relatively small groups of individuals. Here we present a scalable experimental
framework for gathering real-time data resolving face-to-face social
interactions with tunable spatial and temporal granularities. We use active
Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) devices that assess mutual proximity in a
distributed fashion by exchanging low-power radio packets. We analyze the
dynamics of person-to-person interaction networks obtained in three
high-resolution experiments carried out at different orders of magnitude in
community size. The data sets exhibit common statistical properties and lack of
a characteristic time scale from 20 seconds to several hours. The association
between the number of connections and their duration shows an interesting
super-linear behavior, which indicates the possibility of defining
super-connectors both in the number and intensity of connections. Taking
advantage of scalability and resolution, this experimental framework allows the
monitoring of social interactions, uncovering similarities in the way
individuals interact in different contexts, and identifying patterns of
super-connector behavior in the community. These results could impact our
understanding of all phenomena driven by face-to-face interactions, such as the
spreading of transmissible infectious diseases and information.

amino-acids. While the biochemical details of this code were unraveled long
ago, its origin is still obscure. We review information-theoretic approaches to
the problem of the code's origin and discuss the results of a recent work that
treats the code in terms of an evolving, error-prone information channel. Our
model - which utilizes the rate-distortion theory of noisy communication
channels - suggests that the genetic code originated as a result of the
interplay of the three conflicting evolutionary forces: the needs for diverse
amino-acids, for error-tolerance and for minimal cost of resources. The
description of the code as an information channel allows us to mathematically
identify the fitness of the code and locate its emergence at a second-order
phase transition when the mapping of codons to amino-acids becomes nonrandom.
The noise in the channel brings about an error-graph, in which edges connect
codons that are likely to be confused. The emergence of the code is governed by
the topology of the error-graph, which determines the lowest modes of the
graph-Laplacian and is related to the map coloring problem.

Maximum Parsimony method for phylogenetic estimation, which was published by
the Newton Institute in Cambridge on a list of open phylogenetic problems in
2007. This conjecture deals with the question whether Maximum Parsimony trees
are hereditary. The conjecture suggests that a Maximum Parsimony tree for a
particular (DNA) alignment necessarily has subtrees of all possible sizes which
are most parsimonious for the corresponding subalignments. We answer the
conjecture affirmatively for binary alignments on five taxa but also show how
to construct examples for which Maximum Parsimony trees are not hereditary.
Apart from showing that a most parsimonious tree cannot generally be reduced to
a most parsimonious tree on fewer taxa, we also show that compatible most
parsimonious quartets do not have to provide a most parsimonious supertree.
Last, we show that our results can be generalized to Maximum Likelihood for
certain nucleotide substitution models.

of these graphs is shown with analytical arguments. Finally, we measure the
sensitivity to rewiring of this architecture with respect to the clustering
coefficient, and we devise a method to make these networks more robust with

  hydrophobic, hydrophilic and charged residues in protein's structural
  organisation</title><categories>q-bio.BM q-bio.MN</categories><license>http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/</license><abstract>  The three dimensional structure of a protein is an outcome of the
interactions of its constituent amino acids in 3D space. Considering the amino
acids as nodes and the interactions among them as edges we have constructed and
analyzed protein contact networks at different length scales, long and
short-range. While long and short-range interactions are determined by the
positions of amino acids in primary chain, the contact networks are constructed
based on the 3D spatial distances of amino acids. We have further divided these
networks into sub-networks of hydrophobic, hydrophilic and charged residues.
Our analysis reveals that a significantly higher percentage of assortative
sub-clusters of long-range hydrophobic networks helps a protein in
communicating the necessary information for protein folding in one hand; on the
other hand the higher values of clustering coefficients of hydrophobic
sub-clusters play a major role in slowing down the process so that necessary
local and global stability can be achieved through intra connectivities of the
amino acid residues. Further, higher degrees of hydrophobic long-range
interactions suggest their greater role in protein folding and stability. The
small-range all amino acids networks have signature of hierarchy. The present
analysis with other evidences suggest that in a protein's 3D conformational
space, the growth of connectivity is not evolved either through preferential
attachment or through random connections; rather, it follows a specific
structural necessity based guiding principle - where some of the interactions
are primary while the others, generated as a consequence of these primary
interactions are secondary.

introduce a simple rule that, depending on the value of a single parameter $w$,
influences the selection of players that are considered as potential sources of
the new strategy. For positive $w$ players with high payoffs will be considered
more likely, while for negative $w$ the opposite holds. Setting $w$ equal to
zero returns the frequently adopted random selection of the opponent. We find
that increasing the probability of adopting the strategy from the fittest
player within reach, i.e. setting $w$ positive, promotes the evolution of
cooperation. The robustness of this observation is tested against different
levels of uncertainty in the strategy adoption process and for different
interaction network. Since the evolution to widespread defection is tightly
associated with cooperators having a lower fitness than defectors, the fact
that positive values of $w$ facilitate cooperation is quite surprising. We show
that the results can be explained by means of a negative feedback effect that
increases the vulnerability of defectors although initially increasing their
survivability. Moreover, we demonstrate that the introduction of $w$
effectively alters the interaction network and thus also the impact of
uncertainty by strategy adoptions on the evolution of cooperation.

symbols and meanings via error-prone molecular recognition. We describe how
optimizing a code to withstand the impact of molecular recognition noise may be
approximated by the statistics of a two-dimensional network made of polymers.
The noisy code is defined by partitioning the space of symbols into regions
according to their meanings. The "polymers" are the boundaries between these
regions and their statistics defines the cost and the quality of the noisy
code. When the parameters that control the cost-quality balance are varied, the
polymer network undergoes a first-order transition, where the number of encoded
meanings rises discontinuously. Effects of population dynamics on the evolution
of molecular codes are discussed.

amino-acids. Some argue that the specific form of the code with its twenty
amino-acids might be a 'frozen accident' because of the overwhelming effects of
any further change. Others see it as a consequence of primordial biochemical
pathways and their evolution. Here we examine a scenario in which evolution
drives the emergence of a genetic code by selecting for an amino-acid map that
minimizes the impact of errors. We treat the stochastic mapping of codons to
amino-acids as a noisy information channel with a natural fitness measure.
Organisms compete by the fitness of their codes and, as a result, a genetic
code emerges at a supercritical transition in the noisy channel, when the
mapping of codons to amino-acids becomes nonrandom. At the phase transition, a
small expansion is valid and the emergent code is governed by smooth modes of
the Laplacian of errors. These modes are in turn governed by the topology of
the error-graph, in which codons are connected if they are likely to be
confused. This topology sets an upper bound - which is related to the classical
map-coloring problem - on the number of possible amino-acids. The suggested
scenario is generic and may describe a mechanism for the formation of other
error-prone biological codes, such as the recognition of DNA sites by proteins
in the transcription regulatory network.

another molecular language. We introduce a simple model that treats molecular
codes as noisy information channels. An optimal code is a channel that conveys
information accurately and efficiently while keeping down the impact of errors.
The equipoise of the three conflicting needs, for minimal error-load, minimal
cost of resources and maximal diversity of vocabulary, defines the fitness of
the code. The model suggests a mechanism for the emergence of a code when
evolution varies the parameters that control this equipoise and the mapping
between the two molecular languages becomes non-random. This mechanism is
demonstrated by a simple toy model that is formally equivalent to a mean-field
Ising magnet.

targets within a noisy biochemical environment with many look-alikes. Molecular
recognition processes, especially the induced-fit mechanism, are known to
involve conformational changes. This arises a basic question: does molecular
recognition gain any advantage by such conformational changes? By introducing a
simple statistical-mechanics approach, we study the effect of conformation and
flexibility on the quality of recognition processes. Our model relates
specificity to the conformation of the participant molecules and thus suggests
a possible answer: Optimal specificity is achieved when the ligand is slightly
off target, that is a conformational mismatch between the ligand and its main
target improves the selectivity of the process. This indicates that
deformations upon binding serve as a conformational proofreading mechanism,
which may be selected for via evolution.

essential part in the process of carbon fixation through photosynthesis thus
facilitating life on earth. Despite the significant effect that Rubisco has on
the fitness of plants and other photosynthetic organisms, this enzyme is known
to have a remarkably low catalytic rate and a tendency to confuse its
substrate, carbon dioxide, with oxygen. This apparent inefficiency is puzzling
and raises questions regarding the roles of evolution versus biochemical
constraints in shaping Rubisco. Here we examine these questions by analyzing
the measured kinetic parameters of Rubisco from various organisms in various
environments. The analysis presented here suggests that the evolution of
Rubisco is confined to an effectively one-dimensional landscape, which is
manifested in simple power law correlations between its kinetic parameters.
Within this one dimensional landscape, which may represent biochemical and
structural constraints, Rubisco appears to be tuned to the intracellular
environment in which it resides such that the net photosynthesis rate is nearly
optimal. Our analysis indicates that the specificity of Rubisco is not the main
determinant of its efficiency but rather the tradeoff between the carboxylation
velocity and CO2 affinity. As a result, the presence of oxygen has only
moderate effect on the optimal performance of Rubisco, which is determined
mostly by the local CO2 concentration. Rubisco appears as an experimentally
testable example for the evolution of proteins subject both to strong selection
pressure and to biochemical constraints which strongly confine the evolutionary
plasticity to a low dimensional landscape.

biological systems, takes place in a crowded noisy biochemical environment and
requires the recognition of a specific target within a background of various
similar competing molecules. We consider molecular recognition as a
transmission of information via a noisy channel and use this analogy to gain
insights on the optimal, or fittest, molecular recognizer. We focus on the
optimal structural properties of the molecules such as flexibility and
conformation. We show that conformational changes upon binding, which often
occur during molecular recognition, may optimize the detection performance of
the recognizer. We thus suggest a generic design principle termed
'conformational proofreading' in which deformation enhances detection. We
evaluate the optimal flexibility of the molecular recognizer, which is
analogous to the stochasticity in a decision unit. In some scenarios, a
flexible recognizer, i.e., a stochastic decision unit, performs better than a
rigid, deterministic one. As a biological example, we discuss conformational
changes during homologous recombination, the process of genetic exchange
between two DNA strands.

information-processing networks, which convey information via molecular
recognition. Many paths within these networks utilize molecular codebooks, such
as the genetic code, to translate information written in one class of molecules
into another molecular "language" . The present paper examines the emergence
and evolution of molecular codes in terms of rate-distortion theory and reviews
recent results of this approach. We discuss how the biological problem of
maximizing the fitness of an organism by optimizing its molecular coding
machinery is equivalent to the communication engineering problem of designing
an optimal information channel. The fitness of a molecular code takes into
account the interplay between the quality of the channel and the cost of
resources which the organism needs to invest in its construction and
maintenance. We analyze the dynamics of a population of organisms that compete
according to the fitness of their codes. The model suggests a generic mechanism
for the emergence of molecular codes as a phase transition in an information
channel. This mechanism is put into biological context and demonstrated in a
simple example.

expression of genes. They contain DNA binding domains which belong to several
super-families, each with a specific mechanism of DNA binding. The total number
of transcription factors encoded in a genome increases with the number of genes
in the genome. Here, we examined the number of transcription factors from each
super-family in diverse organisms.
  We find that the number of transcription factors from most super-families
appears to be bounded. For example, the number of winged helix factors does not
generally exceed 300, even in very large genomes. The magnitude of the maximal
number of transcription factors from each super-family seems to correlate with
the number of DNA bases effectively recognized by the binding mechanism of that
super-family. Coding theory predicts that such upper bounds on the number of
transcription factors should exist, in order to minimize cross-binding errors
between transcription factors. This theory further predicts that factors with
similar binding sequences should tend to have similar biological effect, so
that errors based on mis-recognition are minimal. We present evidence that
transcription factors with similar binding sequences tend to regulate genes
with similar biological functions, supporting this prediction.
  The present study suggests limits on the transcription factor repertoire of
cells, and suggests coding constraints that might apply more generally to the
mapping between binding sites and biological function.

variation in design. For example, genes can be turned on either by the binding
of an activator (positive control) or the unbinding of a repressor (negative
control). What determines the choice of mode of control for each gene? This
study proposes rules for gene regulation based on the assumption that free
regulatory sites are exposed to nonspecific binding errors, whereas sites bound
to their cognate regulators are protected from errors. Hence, the selected
mechanisms keep the sites bound to their designated regulators for most of the
time, thus minimizing fitness-reducing errors. This offers an explanation of
the empirically demonstrated Savageau demand rule: Genes that are needed often
in the natural environment tend to be regulated by activators, and rarely
needed genes tend to be regulated by repressors; in both cases, sites are bound
for most of the time, and errors are minimized. The fitness advantage of error
minimization appears to be readily selectable. The present approach can also
generate rules for multi-regulator systems. The error-minimization framework
raises several experimentally testable hypotheses. It may also apply to other
biological regulation systems, such as those involving protein-protein
interactions.

societies. Thus far, modeling of pandemics has focused on either large-scale
difference equation models like the SIR and the SEIR models, or detailed
micro-level simulations, which are harder to apply at a global scale. This
paper introduces a hybrid model for pandemics considering both global and local
spread of infections. We hypothesize that the spread of an infectious disease
between regions is significantly influenced by global traffic patterns and the
spread within a region is influenced by local conditions. Thus we model the
spread of pandemics considering the connections between regions for the global
spread of infection and population density based on the SEIR model for the
local spread of infection. We validate our hybrid model by carrying out a
simulation study for the spread of SARS pandemic of 2002-2003 using available
data on population, population density, and traffic networks between different
regions. While it is well-known that international relationships and global
traffic patterns significantly influence the spread of pandemics, our results
show that integrating these factors into relatively simple models can greatly
improve the results of modeling disease spread.

similar competitors in a noisy biochemical environment. Using the basic
framework of signal detection theory, we treat the molecular recognition
process as a signal detection problem and examine its overall performance.
Thus, we evaluate the optimal properties of a molecular recognizer in the
presence of competition and noise. Our analysis reveals that the optimal design
undergoes a "phase transition" as the structural properties of the molecules
and interaction energies between them vary. In one phase, the recognizer should
be complementary in structure to its target (like a lock and a key), while in
the other, conformational changes upon binding, which often accompany molecular
recognition, enhance recognition quality. Using this framework, the abundance
of conformational changes may be explained as a result of increasing the
fitness of the recognizer. Furthermore, this analysis may be used in future
design of artificial signal processing devices based on biomolecules.

synthetic biology. Until recently, most work has been carried out using
intra-cellular oscillators, but this approach restricts the broader
applicability of such systems. Motivated by a desire to develop large-scale,
spatially-distributed cell-based computational systems, we present an initial
design for a population-level oscillator which uses three different bacterial
strains. Our system is based on the client-server model familiar to computer
science, and uses quorum sensing for communication between nodes. We present
the results of extensive in silico simulation tests, which confirm that our
design is both feasible and robust.
